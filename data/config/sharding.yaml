# PyAgent Sharding and Partitioning Configuration
# Controls how agents and tasks are distributed across the swarm.

sharding:
  # The default number of virtual shards in the system
  default_count: 8
  
  # How many nodes should hold a copy of each shard (High Availability)

  # Strategy for shard distribution
  # Options: "consistent_hashing", "random", "load_balanced"
