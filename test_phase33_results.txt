Phase 33: Autonomous Sub-Swarm Spawning & Cross-Modal Teleportation - SUCCESS

1. Sub-Swarm Spawning:
- Verified: spawning ephemeral swarms via SubSwarmSpawner.
- Verified: parallel micro-task execution.
- Fixes: Parameter-aware tool matching (fleet.call_by_capability) allows sub-swarms to find the right agent tools (e.g. ReasoningAgent.analyze) even with generic naming.
- Fixes: Bound methods correctly detected as tools in BaseAgent._register_tools.

2. Cross-Modal Teleportation:
- Verified: Translation between GUI, CODE, SQL, and VOICE modalities.
- Verified: State preservation during teleportation.
- Fixes: Updated ModalTeleportationOrchestrator to match LinguisticAgent.articulate_results signature (technical_report, user_query).

3. Fleet Enhancements:
- Optimized tool selection logic in FleetManager to rank tools based on owner match and parameter compatibility.
- Improved ToolRegistry robustness with filtered keyword argument passing.
