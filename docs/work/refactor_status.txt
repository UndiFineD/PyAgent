# Refactor Status (Jan 11, 2026)

## 🏗️ Structural Overhaul
- **5-Tier Architecture**: Fully implemented with clean division between Core, Logic, Infrastructure, Interface, and Observability.
- **Root Cleanup**: All execution scripts (fix_codebase.py, scan_codebase.py, etc.) moved to `temp/` or `src/scripts/`.
- **Managers Consolidation**: Small manager files merged into `src/core/base/managers/SystemManagers.py`.
- **Types Consolidation**: Fragmentation reduced by moving 12+ Enums/Dataclasses into `src/core/base/models.py`.

## 🔄 Renaming & Reliability
- **Backend -> System**: Provider-agnostic rename of all core infra components (`BackendHealthMonitor` -> `SystemHealthMonitor`, etc.).
- **OrchestratorAgent**: Class `Agent` unified to `OrchestratorAgent` across the codebase.
- **Circular Dependencies**: Resolved core-on-logic dependencies in `BaseAgent` and `OrchestratorAgent` using `@property` lazy-loading.

## 🚀 Phase 130 Features
- **Hopper Matmul Simulator**: Implementation of `src/infrastructure/simulation/HopperSim.py` for H100 performance modeling.
- **Thinking Mode Support**: Added `enable_thinking` and `max_thinking_tokens` to `ModelConfig` for GLM-4.7 and o1 integration.
- **GitHub v2 Importer**: Implemented Auth-header support and pagination logic in `ExternalImporter.py`.
- **PyO3 Stubbing**: Added Rust transition paths in `btree_store.py` for future performance gains.

## ✅ Verification
- All integration tests passing.
- Root directory verified as clean.
- Automated import updates verified across 45+ files.
