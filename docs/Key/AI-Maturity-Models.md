# AI Maturity Models

## What is an AI Maturity Model?
An AI Maturity Model is a framework used to assess an organization's current level of AI capability and to provide a roadmap for advancement. It helps companies understand where they are and what they need to do to become "AI-First."

## Typical Stages of Maturity

### Level 1: Ad Hoc / Experimental
*   **Characteristics**: Individual data scientists or engineers experimenting with AI in silos. No standardized tools or processes. "Shadow AI."
*   **Focus**: Proof of Concepts (PoCs).
*   **Challenges**: Lack of data access, no budget, difficulty moving to production.

### Level 2: Repeatable / Defined
*   **Characteristics**: Some successful pilots. Basic infrastructure (e.g., a cloud notebook environment) is established.
*   **Focus**: Automating specific tasks.
*   **Challenges**: Scaling beyond the initial use cases; data quality issues.

### Level 3: Managed / Operational
*   **Characteristics**: AI is in production for critical business functions. MLOps practices (CI/CD for models) are in place. A centralized "Center of Excellence" (CoE) might exist.
*   **Focus**: Efficiency and reliability.
*   **Challenges**: Governance, bias, and explainability.

### Level 4: Optimized / Systemic
*   **Characteristics**: AI is embedded in the core product and strategy. Data is democratized. The organization has a "Data-First" culture.
*   **Focus**: Innovation and competitive advantage.
*   **Challenges**: Talent retention, ethical AI at scale.

### Level 5: Transformational / AI-Native
*   **Characteristics**: The business model itself relies on AI (e.g., Google, Netflix, Uber). AI drives decision-making at the executive level.
*   **Focus**: Disruption.

## Key Dimensions to Measure
1.  **Strategy**: Is there executive sponsorship?
2.  **Data**: Is data accessible, clean, and governed?
3.  **Technology**: Is the infrastructure (Cloud, GPUs, MLOps) scalable?
4.  **People**: Is there enough talent? Is the wider workforce AI-literate?
5.  **Governance**: Are there policies for ethics and risk?
