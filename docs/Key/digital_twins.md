# Digital Twins

## What is a Digital Twin?
A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, system, or process that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning, and reasoning to help decision-making.

It is more than just a 3D model (CAD); it is a **living** model connected to the real world via IoT sensors.

## Core Components
1.  **Physical Entity**: The real-world object (e.g., a jet engine, a wind turbine, a factory floor, a human heart).
2.  **Virtual Model**: The software representation (physics engine + AI model).
3.  **Data Link**: The continuous flow of data (sensor readings) from physical to virtual, and feedback (control commands) from virtual to physical.

## Use Cases

### 1. Manufacturing (Industry 4.0)
*   **Predictive Maintenance**: Simulating the wear and tear on a machine to predict exactly when a part will fail, reducing downtime.
*   **Process Optimization**: Testing changes to the assembly line in the digital twin before implementing them physically.

### 2. Smart Cities
*   Creating a twin of an entire city (e.g., Virtual Singapore) to simulate traffic flow, energy consumption, or flood response.

### 3. Healthcare (Patient Twin)
*   Creating a digital replica of a patient's physiology to test how they will respond to a specific drug or surgery before the actual procedure.

### 4. AI Training (Sim2Real)
*   Training robots in a physics-accurate digital twin (e.g., NVIDIA Omniverse, Isaac Sim) where they can crash millions of times safely, then transferring that policy to the real robot.

## Technologies
*   **IoT (Internet of Things)**: For data collection.
*   **Cloud/Edge Computing**: For processing the data.
*   **Physics Engines**: (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity) for visual and physical simulation.
*   **AI/ML**: For analyzing the data and making predictions.

## Key Players
*   **NVIDIA Omniverse**: A platform for creating and operating metaverse applications and digital twins.
*   **Siemens**: Industrial digital twins.
*   **General Electric (GE)**: Predix platform.
