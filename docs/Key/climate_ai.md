# Climate AI

AI is emerging as a critical tool in the fight against climate change, enabling better modeling of the Earth system, optimization of renewable energy, and discovery of new materials for decarbonization.

## Key Application Areas

### 1. Weather & Climate Modeling
*   **Task**: Predicting weather (short-term) and climate (long-term) faster and more accurately than traditional physics-based simulations.
*   **Models**: Graph Neural Networks (e.g., Google DeepMind's **GraphCast**), Fourier Neural Operators (FourCastNet).
*   **Impact**: GraphCast can predict 10-day weather in under a minute on a single TPU, outperforming traditional supercomputers. Better hurricane path prediction saves lives.

### 2. Energy Grid Optimization (Smart Grids)
*   **Task**: Balancing supply and demand in a grid with intermittent renewables (Solar/Wind).
*   **Models**: Reinforcement Learning, Time-Series Forecasting.
*   **Impact**: Predicting exactly when the wind will blow or the sun will shine to minimize the use of fossil-fuel peaker plants. Optimizing battery storage discharge.

### 3. Material Discovery (Batteries & Carbon Capture)
*   **Task**: Finding new materials for more efficient batteries, solar panels, or carbon capture sponges.
*   **Models**: Generative Models (GNoME - Graph Networks for Materials Exploration).
*   **Impact**: DeepMind's GNoME discovered 2.2 million new crystals, accelerating the R&D pipeline for clean tech hardware.

### 4. Methane Leak Detection
*   **Task**: Identifying invisible methane leaks from oil & gas infrastructure.
*   **Models**: Computer Vision on satellite/drone imagery (hyperspectral imaging).
*   **Impact**: Methane is 80x more potent than CO2. Fixing leaks is one of the fastest ways to slow warming.

### 5. Precision Agriculture
*   **Task**: Optimizing fertilizer and water usage to reduce runoff and emissions.
*   **Models**: Computer Vision (weed detection), IoT sensor analysis.
*   **Impact**: Reducing the carbon footprint of farming while increasing yields.

## Challenges

*   **Jevons Paradox**: Making AI more efficient might lead to more usage, increasing total energy consumption.
*   **Compute Cost**: Training massive climate models requires massive data centers, which themselves consume energy and water. (Green AI).
*   **Data Gaps**: We lack high-quality climate data for many parts of the Global South.
