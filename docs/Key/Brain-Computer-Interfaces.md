# Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)

## What is a BCI?
A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device. It allows for bidirectional information flow: reading signals from the brain to control computers, or writing signals to the brain to restore senses.

## Types of BCIs

### 1. Invasive (Implanted)
*   **Method**: Electrodes are surgically implanted directly into the brain tissue (cortex).
*   **Pros**: Highest signal quality (single-neuron resolution).
*   **Cons**: Requires brain surgery; risk of infection/rejection; scar tissue formation.
*   **Examples**:
    *   **Neuralink**: Developing high-bandwidth threads to treat paralysis and eventually merge humans with AI.
    *   **Blackrock Neurotech**: The "Utah Array," used in research for decades.

### 2. Semi-Invasive
*   **Method**: Electrodes are placed on the surface of the brain (ECoG) or inside blood vessels (Stentrode), but not penetrating the tissue.
*   **Example**: **Synchron**: Uses a stent inserted via the jugular vein to reach the motor cortex without open brain surgery.

### 3. Non-Invasive (Wearable)
*   **Method**: Sensors placed on the scalp (EEG) or using light (fNIRS).
*   **Pros**: Safe, consumer-friendly.
*   **Cons**: Low signal quality; "noisy" data; cannot read deep brain structures.
*   **Examples**: Muse headbands (meditation), NextMind (visual control).

## Applications
1.  **Medical (Restoration)**:
    *   Restoring movement to paralyzed limbs (bypassing the spinal cord).
    *   Restoring speech to "locked-in" patients by decoding intended speech from neural activity.
    *   Treating blindness (visual cortex stimulation).
2.  **Augmentation**:
    *   Controlling computers/phones with thought (telepathy).
    *   Memory enhancement (hippocampal prosthetics).
3.  **AI Symbiosis**:
    *   The long-term goal of increasing the "bandwidth" between humans and AI to prevent humans from becoming obsolete in the age of AGI.

## Ethical Concerns
*   **Privacy**: Who owns your neural data ("Neurorights")? Can your thoughts be hacked?
*   **Identity**: Does a BCI change your personality or sense of self?
*   **Inequality**: Will cognitive enhancement be available only to the rich?
