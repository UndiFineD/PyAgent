# AI Winters

## Overview
An **AI Winter** is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. These periods are characterized by skepticism, cuts in government grants, and a general feeling that AI has failed to live up to its hype.

## The First AI Winter (1974–1980)
*   **Cause**: The "Lighthill Report" (1973) in the UK and DARPA funding cuts in the US.
*   **Reason**: Early AI researchers (like Marvin Minsky) made grandiose predictions ("Within a generation ... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved").
*   **Reality**: The systems were brittle "toy" programs that couldn't handle real-world complexity or combinatorial explosion.
*   **Outcome**: Funding shifted to more practical projects.

## The Second AI Winter (1987–1993)
*   **Cause**: The collapse of the **Lisp Machine** market.
*   **Context**: In the early 80s, "Expert Systems" were booming. Companies bought expensive, specialized hardware (Lisp Machines) to run them.
*   **Reason**: General-purpose PCs (IBM, Apple) became powerful enough to run Lisp code cheaper than specialized hardware. The "AI Bubble" burst.
*   **Outcome**: "AI" became a dirty word. Researchers started using terms like "Machine Learning", "Pattern Recognition", or "Computational Statistics" to get funding.

## Are We Heading for a Third Winter?
*   **The Hype**: Generative AI (LLMs) has created massive expectations (and massive spending).
*   **The Risk**: If LLMs hit a wall (e.g., running out of training data, inability to reason reliably, high energy costs), investment could dry up.
*   **The Difference**: Unlike previous winters, modern AI is already generating billions in revenue and is embedded in products used by millions (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Coding Assistants). It is no longer just research; it is a utility.
