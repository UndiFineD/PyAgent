# The Deep Learning Revolution

## Overview
The **Deep Learning Revolution** refers to the explosive growth of Artificial Neural Networks starting around 2012, which shifted the field from manual feature engineering to end-to-end learning.

## The Catalyst: ImageNet 2012
*   **The Competition**: The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Classifying 1.2 million images into 1000 categories.
*   **The Winner**: **AlexNet** (by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton).
*   **The Result**: AlexNet achieved a top-5 error rate of 15.3%, smashing the previous state-of-the-art (26.2%). This margin was so massive it shocked the community.

## The Trinity of Success
Three factors converged to make this possible:
1.  **Big Data**: The internet provided massive labeled datasets (ImageNet) that didn't exist in the 80s/90s.
2.  **Algorithms**: Improvements like **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit) solved the vanishing gradient problem, and **Dropout** prevented overfitting.
3.  **Hardware (GPUs)**: AlexNet was trained on two NVIDIA GTX 580 GPUs. GPUs (originally for gaming) turned out to be perfect for the parallel matrix multiplications required by neural nets.

## The Aftermath
*   **2013-2015**: Computer Vision switched entirely to CNNs (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet).
*   **2016**: AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol.
*   **2017**: The Transformer architecture was invented ("Attention Is All You Need"), bringing the revolution to NLP.
*   **2020s**: Generative AI (GPT-3, Stable Diffusion).

## Key Figures (The Godfathers)
*   **Geoffrey Hinton**: Backpropagation, Boltzmann Machines.
*   **Yann LeCun**: CNNs (LeNet), Chief AI Scientist at Meta.
*   **Yoshua Bengio**: Sequence modeling, GANs.
*   (These three shared the Turing Award in 2018).
