# Embodied Cognition

## The Theory
Embodied Cognition is the theory that many features of cognition (thinking, understanding, intelligence) are shaped by aspects of the entire body of the organism. The mind is not just a computer processing symbols in a void; it is deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world.

## Implications for AI
*   **The "Brain in a Vat" Problem**: Traditional AI (like LLMs) are disembodied. They process text about "apples" but have never held, smelled, or tasted one.
*   **Grounding**: Embodied AI argues that for an AI to truly "understand" the physical world, it must have a physical presence (a robot body) and sensory-motor capabilities.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Moravec's Paradox
*   "It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility."
*   High-level reasoning requires very little computation, but low-level sensorimotor skills require enormous computational resources.

### 2. Affordances
*   The idea (from J.J. Gibson) that we perceive objects not just by their shape/color, but by what actions they *afford* us.
*   A chair "affords" sitting; a handle "affords" grasping. An embodied AI must learn these affordances.

### 3. Active Perception
*   We don't just passively receive visual data; we move our eyes and heads to get better information. Perception is an active process.

## Current Research
*   **Google DeepMind (RT-2)**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that control robots.
*   **Tesla Optimus**: A humanoid robot designed to perform general tasks.
*   **Figure AI**: Integrating OpenAI's models into humanoid robots.

## Conclusion
While LLMs have shown surprising reasoning capabilities without a body, many researchers believe that **AGI** will require embodiment to fully understand cause-and-effect in the physical world.
