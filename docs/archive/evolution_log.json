# SWARM STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE - PHASE 131
# Optimization: Reducing cycle time via targeted focus and pre-emptive commands.

@focus: src/core, src/infrastructure/fleet, src/logic/agents
@cmd: python temp/fix_headers.py
@cmd: python temp/verify_imports.py

# High-Level Instructions:
please **improve the directory structure** to sort the different type of files, 
and reorder all the files fix the imports and test the whole. 
do not put code files in the root folder but use temp . 
use temp to create temporary scripts.
record the desired directory structure in docs\work\directories.txt

It might be a good idea to **pay special attention to data** 
as i suspect that specific knowledge can better be stored per agent, 
we are expectiong a trillion parameters, 
so we better be smart in dividing and writing and accessing data 
(btrees and vectors and graphs)
record the needed changes in docs\work\datastructures.md

maybe some **source files should be renamed to better reflect their function** 
record the needed filename changes in docs\work\filenamechanges.txt 
original path and new path on the same line.

**tests probably needs a directory structure** to make it clear 
what part we are testing with more pytest and unittest
record test structure in docs\work\teststructure.md

**implement fixes for** docs\work\Improvements_needed.md docs\work\IMPROVEMENT_RESEARCH.md
remove those that have been fixed and tested
Scan codebase in src and plugins for remaining things to do
and add them to docs\work\Improvements_needed.md

**Rust Transition**: maintain docs\work\RUST_Ready.md
**repair docs\autodoc**: make sure docs\autodoc documents 
and others not yet created are still being generated
**create more docs\Key documents**: do research on docs\work\IMPROVEMENT_RESEARCH.md 
and, create and maintain more documents, 
mention writers, original date and source links, the usual for reseacrh documents.

remove deploy folder from code

move config to data\config also in code
move models to data\models also in code
move plugins to src\plugins for community changes

see if we can reuse code in temp in other parts of the program 
to improve robustness stability or testing 
and eliminate those code files in temp when no longer in use
