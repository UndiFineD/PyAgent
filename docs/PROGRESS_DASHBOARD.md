Code Metrics
Total Lines of Code: ~3,500+
Test Coverage: >90%
Linting Errors: 0
Type Errors: 0
Recent Achievements
Full Type Safety: Resolved all Pylance/MyPy strict mode errors.
Linting Cleanliness: Achieved 0 Flake8 violations across the codebase.
Documentation Overhaul: Rewrote corrupted documentation files (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, etc.).
Test Stability: Fixed all flaky tests and ensured consistent green builds.
Modular Architecture: Successfully refactored the entire codebase from legacy monolithic scripts to a clean, class-based modular structure with thin stubs. Standardized naming to underscored versions (e.g., `agent_coder.py`) to ensure cross-platform subprocess compatibility and PEP8 compliance.
Advanced Integration: Implemented semantic vector search (ChromaDB) and native Search APIs (Google/Bing).
Regression Fix: Restored 100% test pass rate for core modules after the modularization shift by repairing broken namespace exports in stubs.

Next Steps
Build and release v1.0.0.
Monitor CI/CD workflows for automated documentation maintenance.
Expand specialist agent capabilities.
