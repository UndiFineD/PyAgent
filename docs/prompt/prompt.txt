# Strategic Improvement Directives (Phase 317)
# Priority: HIGH | Focus: Logic Complexity & Type Safety
@focus: ["src/maintenance", "src/logic", "src/infrastructure/orchestration"]

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Complexity Reduction (CRITICAL)
- Target the 32 files identified with **Cyclomatic Complexity > 25**.
- Break down monolithic functions into smaller, deterministic helper methods.
- Prioritize `src/logic/agents` and `src/infrastructure/orchestration`.

### 2. Type Safety & Rust Portability
- Inject explicit type hints into all `src/infrastructure` orchestrators.
- Focus on method arguments and return values.
- Ensure `self` is not typed, but all other complex objects (Fleet, Agents) are.

### 3. Documentation Injection (Maintenance Phase)
- Ensure every file in `src/maintenance` has a module-level docstring starting with triple quotes.
- Verify that every public class has a high-quality docstring explaining its role in the 5-tier architecture.

### 4. Swarm Intelligence Verification
- Use `SelfImprovementOrchestrator` to apply "Swarm Intelligence Fixes" based on the latest interaction shards.
- Validate that lessons from Shard 220 (Copilot CLI deprecation patterns) are being processed.

### 5. FFI Stability Check
- Ensure Python type hints align with the expected signatures in `rust_core.pyd`.
- Identify functions in `src/core` that are candidates for the next wave of Rust oxidation (Phase 318).

## Quality Gates
- All autonomous fixes must maintain system stability (Stability Gate 1.0).
- No regression in interaction recording performance.
- Validated masking of all sensitive tokens in logs.

## Exclusions
- Do not modify files in `temp/` or `data/`.
- Skip documentation injection for `__init__.py` files unless they contain significant logic.
