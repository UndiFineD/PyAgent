# PyAgent Workspace Context
# Generated: January 22, 2026
# Version: 4.0.0 (Phase 90 - The Swarm Singularity)

## Project Overview
PyAgent is a production-grade Swarm Evolution architecture. It has transitioned from a 
multi-agent orchestration system into a self-optimizing "Swarm Infinity" platform, 
supporting 1M+ token context sharding, multi-tenancy, and federated meta-optimization.

## Architecture (Distributed Swarm)
- src/core/          → Synaptic Primitives, Multi-tenant Cryptography, Global State.
- src/logic/         → Swarm Intelligence, Reward-based Expert Routing, Meta-Learning.
- src/infrastructure/→ Swarm P2P (RDMA), Raft Consensus, LSH Memory Sharding, Federated Optimizer.
- src/interface/     → AgentBar (120fps dashboard), Swarm CLI, Web Fleet Balancer.
- src/observability/ → Grid Telemetry, Global Trace Synthesis, Decision Auditing.

## Rust Acceleration (rust_core/)
- **680+ PyO3 functions** for high-throughput swarm operations (P2P, LSH, Raft).
- **Core Acceleration**: LSH-based O(1) retrieval, RDMA-simulated transfer stubs.
- **Phase 90**: Federated Tuning, Landmark Distillation, and Query De-duplication.

## Current State (Phase 90 The Swarm Singularity)
- Test baseline: ~4,500+ tests with 100% pass rate.
- vLLM Integration: Phase 90 complete, 680 Rust functions, ~240 Python modules.
- Swarm Stability: Raft-based consensus verified for decentralized rank agreement.
- Self-Optimization: Federated Meta-Optimizer dynamically nudges swarm hyperparameters.
- Memory: Distilled KV-cache shards migrate across nodes via optimized P2P pipelines.

## vLLM & Swarm Integration Summary
| Phase | Focus | Modules | Rust Fns |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| 1-50  | Core & TALON | ~195 | 532 |
| 51-70 | Infrastructure | ~25 | 80 |
| 71-90 | Swarm Evolution| ~20 | 68 |
| **Total** | - | **~240** | **680** |

## Data & Observability
- 1M+ token context sharding using LSH buckets for O(1) semantic search.
- Global Trace Synthesis: Extracts "Collective Wisdom" from agent reasoning logs.
- MCP Discovery: Autonomous semantic indexing of external tool servers.

## Known Issues (Future Phase Focus)
- [PENDING] Phase 91: Real-time Semantic Cache Invalidation.
- [PENDING] Phase 92: Attention-Entropy based Neural Context Pruning.
- [PENDING] Phase 97: Petabyte-scale Agent RAG.

## Strategic Directives
- **Cascade Context**: Unified task attribution across all swarm nodes.
- **Swarm Liquidity**: Zero-downtime rank-reassignment and context re-sharding.
- **Meta-Cognition**: Self-generating architectural and Rust-core improvements.


## fixed prompt
- delegate among multiple agents
- update and maintain a roadmap in docs\prompt\roadmap.txt
- update docs\prompt\context.txt and docs\prompt\prompt.txt

## Context Management
- **Cascade Context**: Passing a `CascadeContext` object through all recursive agent calls to track lineage and prevent "hallucination loops."

- work towards automating the self improvement process 
- monitor docs\prompt\improvements.md for new texts and websites that may have new insights.
- we have a lot of code, some of it may need refactoring, 
some have become to big and need splitting of into several parts or new subject, 
- try to lazy load modules and imports, 
- the idea is that in the future we will utlise multiple machine 
in the local network or on the internet to do work for us. 
see what we can do with google gemini gcp, or aws or microsoft azure ai integrations, 
without costing us an arm and a leg, 
- our goal is to bring in all the improvements and research 
to become the best streaming ai out there.  
- research process: Automated synthesis of papers from https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent?skip=0&show=2000. 
- Integrated latest architectural research (arXiv:2601.10696 & ASEJ S2090447925006203) into `ArchitecturalDesignAgent`.
- research workflow: Find -> Summarize in `data\Research` -> Map to Agent Logic -> Implement & Test -> Update `improvements.md`.
- copy and implement AgentBar [DONE]
- systematically refactored monolithic infrastructure files (>500 lines) into facades [IN-PROGRESS]
- when the number of pending changes is above 50, 
review with coderabbit, do the git dance, merge branches into main
