# PyAgent Workspace Context
# Generated: January 19, 2026
# Version: 3.19.0 (Evolution Phase 51 - Multimedia & Attention)

## Project Overview
PyAgent is an AI-powered multi-agent orchestration system for autonomous code improvement,
now evolving into a high-performance streaming AI platform supporting 120fps multimodal I/O.

## Architecture (5-Tiered)
- src/core/          → Primitives, Knowledge Trinity (B-Tree, Vector, Graph)
- src/logic/         → Swarm Intelligence, Specialized Agents, Reasoning Strategies  
- src/infrastructure/→ Fleet Management, Economy, AI Engine (TensorRT/vLLM), Multimedia (120fps DVD-Channels), Disaggregated Workers.
- src/interface/     → Multi-UI layer (CLI, Web, Mobile/Flutter)
- src/observability/ → Telemetry, Stats, Reporting, Audit Trails

## Rust Acceleration (rust_core/)
- **543+ PyO3 functions** for CPU-bound operations and hardware acceleration.
- **Hardware-Aware Neural Engine**: Supports CUDA, TensorRT, and AMD NPU.
- Performance: 120fps throughput verified on Tier 3 (Infrastructure) hotspots.
- **Phase 51**: TensorRT initialization, IA3 scaling, advanced attention kernels, binary multi-channel MUX (新增 11 Rust functions).

## Current State (Phase 51 Multimedia)
- Test baseline: ~3,100+ tests with 100% collection health.
- vLLM Integration: Phase 51 active, 543 Rust functions, ~203 Python modules.
- Multimedia: Transitioning to TensorRT + IA³ + Quantization for real-time video/audio (120fps ready).
- Self-Healing: Active via SelfImprovementCoordinator + DirectorAgent cycle.
- Research Integration: Full Arxiv-to-Logic pipeline active; ArxivCore + Architectural Mapping implemented.

## vLLM Integration Summary (Phases 17-51)
| Phase | Focus | Modules | Rust Fns |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| 17-50 | Core & TALON | ~195 | 532 |
| 51 | Multimedia & Attention | 8 | 11 |
| **Total** | - | **~203** | **543** |

## Data & Observability
- 1,024 virtual shards for interaction history (Rust-native sharding index).
- Full parity for multimodal tags: Time, Commandshell, Hardware, Security, etc. (40+ tags across 51 categories).
- AgentBar: Real-time 120fps dashboard component integrated.

## Known Issues to Address (Phase 52 Focus)
- [PENDING] Phase 52: Multi-GPU & Distributed Inference (TP/PP/EP).
- [PENDING] Modularization: Finalize remaining files in `src/logic/agents/`.
- [PENDING] Research: Implement PackKV (lossy compression) in `KVCacheCoordinator`.

## fixed prompt
- delegate among multiple agents
- update and maintain a roadmap in docs\prompt\roadmap.txt
- update docs\prompt\context.txt and docs\prompt\prompt.txt
- work towards automating the self improvement process 
- monitor docs\prompt\improvements.md for new texts and websites that may have new insights.
- we have a lot of code, some of it may need refactoring, 
some have become to big and need splitting of into several parts or new subject, 
- try to lazy load modules and imports, 
- the idea is that in the future we will utlise multiple machine 
in the local network or on the internet to do work for us. 
see what we can do with google gemini gcp, or aws or microsoft azure ai integrations, 
without costing us an arm and a leg, 
- our goal is to bring in all the improvements and research 
to become the best streaming ai out there.  
- research process: Automated synthesis of papers from https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent?skip=0&show=2000. 
- Integrated latest architectural research (arXiv:2601.10696 & ASEJ S2090447925006203) into `ArchitecturalDesignAgent`.
- research workflow: Find -> Summarize in `data\Research` -> Map to Agent Logic -> Implement & Test -> Update `improvements.md`.
- copy and implement AgentBar [DONE]
- systematically refactored monolithic infrastructure files (>500 lines) into facades [IN-PROGRESS]
- when the number of pending changes is above 50, 
review with coderabbit, do the git dance, merge branches into main
