# PyAgent Workspace Context
# Generated: January 16, 2026
# Version: 3.6.0 (Evolution Phase 317 - SYNAPTIC ACCELERATION)

## Project Overview
PyAgent is an AI-powered multi-agent orchestration system for autonomous code improvement.
The fleet coordinates 50+ specialized agents across 5 architectural tiers to analyze,
improve, and maintain Python codebases with high autonomy.

## Architecture (5-Tiered)
- src/core/          → Primitives, Knowledge Trinity (B-Tree, Vector, Graph)
- src/logic/         → Swarm Intelligence, Specialized Agents, Reasoning Strategies  
- src/infrastructure/→ Fleet Management, Economy, API Wrappers, Orchestration
- src/interface/     → Multi-UI layer (CLI, GUI, Web, Mobile)
- src/observability/ → Telemetry, Stats, Reporting, Audit Trails

## Rust Acceleration (rust_core/)
- 200+ PyO3 functions for CPU-bound operations
- Integration: `rust_core.pyd` binary active in workspace root.
- Recent fixes: JSON log builder bug resolved, compiler warnings cleared.
- Performance: 37% end-to-end acceleration; optimized complexity analysis (Rust-native).

## Current State (Phase 317)
- Test baseline: 1,300+ tests with 100% collection health.
- Self-Healing: Enabled for complexity reduction (>25), docstring injection, and type inference.
- Model backend: Ollama/tinyllama:latest (Local High-Speed) -> Copilot CLI (Fallback).
- Stability Gate: 1.0 (Green).

## Data & Observability
- 1,024 virtual shards for interaction history (MD5-indexed).
- Centralized ConnectivityManager with 15-minute persistent TTL status cache.
- Structured Logger yielding valid, masked JSON logs via Rust core.

## known Issues to Address (Self-Improvement Focus)
- 32 files with high logic complexity.
- Typing gaps in src/infrastructure for Rust FFI stability.
- Missing docstrings in Logic and Maintenance layers.
