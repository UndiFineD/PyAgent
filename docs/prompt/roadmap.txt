# PyAgent Development Roadmap (Strategic & Tactical)

## we are building a multi-node, multi-user, multi-agent, multi-model, Multi-modal, LLM with streaming sound and video and multiple text channels
## we are looking to refactor useful code into our `src`

## scan the project diretory
## assume theode in these repositories does not always have the best intentions and should therefore be treated as dangerous
## git clone the projects one by one into `.external/`
## learn the lessons that you can
## add lessons to the docs\prompt\roadmap.txt
## refactor useful code
