# Improvements: `agent_stats.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add `--help` examples and validate CLI args (paths, required files).
- Function `main` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
- File: `src\agent_stats.py`
