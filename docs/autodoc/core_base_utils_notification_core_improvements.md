# Improvements: `NotificationCore.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Avoid broad `except:` or `except Exception:`; catch specific errors.
- Consider documenting class construction / expected invariants.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
