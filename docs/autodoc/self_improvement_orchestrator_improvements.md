# Improvements: `SelfImprovementOrchestrator.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add a concise module docstring describing purpose / usage.
- Avoid broad `except:` or `except Exception:`; catch specific errors.
- Function `__init__` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
