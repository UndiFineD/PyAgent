# Improvements: `CodeQualityAgent.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add a concise module docstring describing purpose / usage.
- Add robust subprocess error handling (`check=True`, timeouts, clearer stderr reporting).

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
