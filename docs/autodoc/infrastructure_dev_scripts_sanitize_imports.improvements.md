# Improvements: `sanitize_imports.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add a concise module docstring describing purpose / usage.
- Consider using `logging` instead of `print` for controllable verbosity.
- Function `sanitize_file` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
