# Improvements: `SwarmTopologyReporter.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add a concise module docstring describing purpose / usage.
- Function `__init__` is missing type annotations.
- Function `export` is missing type annotations.
- Function `record_link` is missing type annotations.
- Function `record_node` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
