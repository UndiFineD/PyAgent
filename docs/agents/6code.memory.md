# 6code Memory

This file tracks code implementation notes, 
refactor decisions, and code health observations.

## Auto-handoff

Once code implementation is complete and tests are passing, 
the next agent to invoke is **@7exec**. 
This should be done via `agent/runSubagent`.

| **status** | DONE |
| **summary** | Documentation update: made `@0master` the explicit owner of `prjNNN` allocation and continuity, required `@1project` to consume the assigned identifier and fail closed on missing or ambiguous numbering, and mirrored the rule in master memory plus the active prj030 design/code artifacts. |

## prj030 - agent-doc-policy-tests

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **task_id** | prj030-agent-doc-policy-tests |
| **owner_agent** | @6code |
| **source** | @5test |
| **created_at** | 2026-03-20 |
| **updated_at** | 2026-03-20 |
| **status** | DONE |
| **summary** | Added a single pytest file that guards the governing workflow docs against regressions in `prjNNN` ownership, project overview template sections, branch/scope validation rules, blanket staging prohibitions, failure disposition, and lessons learned requirements. |
| **changed_modules** | tests/docs/test_agent_workflow_policy_docs.py; docs/project/prj030-agent-doc-frequency/agent-doc-frequency.code.md; docs/agents/6code.memory.md |
| **verification_commands** | c:/Dev/PyAgent/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/docs/test_agent_workflow_policy_docs.py -q |
| **verification_result** | PASS — 3 passed in 1.50s |
| **unresolved_risks** | The tests are phrase-based by design; they protect policy presence without trying to validate legacy project artifacts. |
| **handoff_target** | @7exec |
| **artifact_paths** | tests/docs/test_agent_workflow_policy_docs.py, docs/project/prj030-agent-doc-frequency/agent-doc-frequency.code.md, docs/agents/6code.memory.md |
