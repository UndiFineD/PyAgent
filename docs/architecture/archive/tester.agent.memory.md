## Memory Storage & Future Reference
This file serves as comprehensive documentation of the testing phase for PyAgent v4.0.0 improvements. It should be referenced during implementation to ensure alignment with testing requirements and updated as the project progresses.

---
## Rationale
To ensure robust, maintainable, and verifiable agent logic, every src/*.py module must have a corresponding src/*_test.py file. All public classes and functions are covered by meaningful pytest unit tests. This guarantees traceability, prevents coverage gaps, and aligns with PyAgent's v4.0.0 roadmap for autonomous code improvement and validation.

## Coverage Map (params & models)
- src/infrastructure/engine/structured/params/validator.py → validator_test.py
- src/infrastructure/engine/structured/params/factory.py → factory_test.py
- src/infrastructure/engine/structured/params/enums.py → enums_test.py
- src/infrastructure/engine/structured/params/constraints.py → constraints_test.py
- src/infrastructure/engine/structured/params/config.py → config_test.py
- src/infrastructure/engine/structured/models.py → models_test.py

All public classes/functions in these modules are now covered by pytest tests.

## Progress
- Identify src modules missing *_test.py
- Generate pytest test files for params & models modules
- Continue for remaining uncovered modules
- Ensure all public classes/functions are tested in each module
- Update coverage map as new tests are added

## Next Steps
- Continue generating test files for remaining uncovered src modules
- Prioritize core/critical agent and utility logic
- Update this memory file with rationale and coverage as progress continues
