- [STATE] Ensure that `Vibe-Coding` tracks persist their state across multiple agent invocations by storing the `active_track` in the `agent_state.json`.
- [MAPREDUCE] Implement a functional `orchestrate_mapreduce` that splits a file into chunks, processes them with parallel `BashAgent` or `CoderAgent` instances, and merges the results.

# PHASE 284: PERSISTENT RESOURCE ECONOMY
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/swarm/ResourceArbitratorAgent.py",
    "src/logic/agents/swarm/FleetEconomyAgent.py"
]
- [ECONOMY] Replace the in-memory `resource_ledger` with a persistent **DuckDB** or **SQLite** backend in `data/db/swarm_economy.db`.
- [AUCTION] Implement a "Sealed-Bid Second-Price" auction mechanism in `FleetEconomyAgent.py` for GPU token allocation during period of high swarm congestion.
- [AUDIT] Create a `FleetEconomyAgent` tool to audit the "Wealth Distribution" of the swarm—identifying agents that are "starving" (zero credits) and rebalancing via "System Grants."

# PHASE 285: BYZANTINE FAULT TOLERANT CONSENSUS
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/swarm/SwarmArbitratorAgent.py"
]
- [CONSENSUS] Implement a simplified **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)** algorithm. If 3 agents are asked for the same verification and 1 disagrees, a "Consensus Conflict Agent" is spawned to perform a line-by-line audit.
- [REPUTATION] Track "Agent Reputation" scores in `ShardedKnowledgeCore`. Agents with high hallucination rates have their bids temporarily deprioritized in the resource market.

# PHASE 286: SPECIALIZED BUSINESS PERSONAS
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/specialized/"
]
- [LEGAL] Implement `LegalAuditAgent.py` to check for license compliance (specifically verifying that all third-party code matches the project's Apache 2.0 / MIT requirements).
- [FINANCE] Implement `FinancialAgent.py` to estimate the real-world dollar cost of an improvement cycle based on token prices for each model (Ollama=0.00$, GPT-4o=15.00/1M, etc.).
- [COMPLIANCE] Implement `PrivacyGuardAgent.py` (Phase 157) to scan for AWS keys or private auth tokens that were accidentally committed.

# PHASE 287: ASYNC "BASEAGENT" REFACTOR
@focus: [
    "src/core/base/BaseAgent.py",
    "src/core/base/AgentCore.py"
]
- [ASYNC] Transition `BaseAgent.improve_content` and all `@as_tool` methods to native `async def`.
- [CONCURRENCY] Update the `PhaseOrchestrator` to use `asyncio.gather()` when launching non-dependent agent shards, maximizing the throughput of the `Ollama` / `VLLM` backend.

# PHASE 288: WASM/DOCKER PLUGIN SANDBOXING
@focus: [
    "src/core/base/managers/PluginManager.py",
    "plugins/"
]
- [SANDBOX] Implement a "Restricted Mode" for plugins. Use a `docker-py` wrapper or a WASM runtime (like `wasmer`) to execute untrusted third-party plugins in `plugins/` without granting them full filesystem access.
- [MANIFEST] Require a `permissions.json` in every plugin folder (e.g., `["read:src", "write:temp"]`). Enforce these permissions via the `PluginManager`.

# PHASE 289: PYTHON 3.13 MIGRATION & DEPRECATION AUDIT
@focus: [
    "src/"
]
- [AUDIT] Run `ruff check . --select=UP` and `pyupgrade` to identify and fix all modules scheduled for removal in Python 3.13 (like `cgi`, `pipes`, `telnetlib`).
- [SYNTAX] Modernize all `TypeAlias` declarations to use the Python 3.12 `type` keyword.

# PHASE 290: THE "PROXIMA" GRAFANA BRIDGE
@focus: [
    "src/observability/stats/CloudExporter.py",
    "docs/notes/DASHBOARD.md"
]
- [VISUALIZATION] Implement the **Grafana Bridge** (as planned in Phase 131). Export swarm health, token consumption, and sharding clusters to a Prometheus/Grafana endpoint for real-time NOC (Network Operations Center) style monitoring.
- [TOPOLOGY] Ensure the Grafana dashboard can render a live **Force-Directed Graph** of the agent sharding clusters.

# PHASE 291: THE MISSION COMPLETE SIGNAL
@focus: [
    "version.py"
]
- [SIGNAL] Upon successful completion of Phase 290, perform a "Total Workspace Freeze."
- [RELEASE] Tag as `v2.2.0-ULTIMA-COMPLETE`. Send the `FleetStatus.SHUTDOWN` signal to the `SignalBusOrchestrator`.
- [LOG] Final Message: "The Swarm has reached maximal synergy. Maintenance mode engaged."

# PHASE 292: CONFUCIUS HIERARCHICAL MEMORY (Meta CCA)
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/cognitive/HierarchicalMemoryAgent.py",
    "src/logic/agents/cognitive/LongTermMemory.py"
]
- [SCAFOLDING] Implement hierarchical working memory (as seen in Confucius Code Agent). Agents must maintain three layers: `ShortTerm` (Current Task), `Working` (Cross-file Context), and `LongTerm` (Archived Insights).
- [NOTES] Implement a "Persistent Scratchpad" tool for every agent, allowing them to take notes during massive directory scans that persist across multiple `delegate()` calls.

# PHASE 293: LINGUISTIC LATENT REASONING ANCHOR
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/cognitive/LinguisticAgent.py",
    "src/core/base/verification.py"
]
- [LATENT] Implement the "Latent Reasoning Verification" technique (arxiv:2601.02996). When an agent reasons in a non-English language, the `Verifier` must check if the "Hidden State" vectors align with the English-reasoning baseline to identify "Silent Reasoning" weaknesses.
- [AUDIT] Add a linguistic parity check—ensure code comments generated in non-English languages match the quality/intent of the English documentation.

# PHASE 294: DYNAMIC BACKEND HEURISTICS (DEEPSEEK V4/GLM4.7)
@focus: [
    "src/infrastructure/backend/RunnerBackends.py",
    "src/infrastructure/orchestration/RoutingEngine.py"
]
- [ROUTING] Implement a "Cost-Efficiency" heuristic. If a task is "Low-Complexity Coding," route to `GLM-4.7` or `DeepSeek V4` (via OpenRouter/KiloCode) to save 85% on token costs.
- [FALLBACK] Automatically fallback to `GPT-4.5-Sonnet` only when `ReasoningCertainty` drops below 0.7 on frontier tasks.

# PHASE 295: FP8 HOPPER OPTIMIZATION (FP8-MATMUL)
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/system/ModelOptimizerAgent.py",
    "temp/simulate_hopper.py"
]
- [OPTIMIZE] Integrate the `HopperSim` mathematics into the `ModelForgeAgent`.
- [QUANTIZATION] Automate the generation of FP8-quantized Llama-3-70B weights for local deployment on NVIDIA H100/H200 nodes using the simulation results in `temp/simulate_hopper.py`.

# PHASE 296: DIGITAL RED QUEEN (ADVERSARIAL EVOLUTION)
@focus: [
    "tests/adversarial/RedQueenBenchmark.py",
    "src/logic/agents/security/EthicsGuardrailAgent.py"
]
- [ADVERSARIAL] Implement the "Digital Red Queen" (Sakana AI) benchmark. Task a "Red Team" agent with evolving prompts intended to bypass the `EthicsGuardrailAgent`.
- [HARDENING] Use the winning bypass-prompts to fine-tune the `EthicsGuardrail` system prompt, creating a self-reinforcing security loop.

# PHASE 297: CONCRETE FLEET ECONOMY (TOKEN-BILLING)
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/swarm/FleetEconomyAgent.py",
    "src/observability/stats/TokenCostCore.py"
]
- [BILLING] Integrate `TokenCostCore.py` directly into the `FleetEconomyAgent`. After every agent response, calculate the actual cost and "Deduct" it from the agent's virtual wallet.
- [INCENTIVES] Grant bonus credits to agents whose modifications pass the `TestAgent` verification on the first attempt.

# PHASE 298: DYNAMIC TOOL SYNTHESIS
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/development/ToolSynthesisAgent.py"
]
- [SYNTHESIS] Implement the logical loop where an agent can say "I need a tool that does X" and the `ToolSynthesisAgent` writes, tests, and registers a new Python tool in `src/infrastructure/orchestration/tools/` in real-time.

# PHASE 299: SECRET MANAGEMENT HARDENING
@focus: [
    "tests/unit/logic/test_coder_UNIT.py",
    "tests/integration/test_backend_integration.py"
]
- [SECRETS] Purge all placeholder `sk_live_...` and `ghp_...` tokens from the test files. 
- [INJECTION] Implement a `SecretManager` tool that pulls credentials from environment variables or encrypted `data/secrets.enc` files, ensuring no keys are ever logged to `data/logs/structured.json`.

# PHASE 300: PROXIMA INFININTY (THE SWARM SOVEREIGNTY)
@focus: [
    "version.py"
]
- [SOVEREIGNTY] Implement the `SovereigntyOrchestrator.py` logic (Phase 131). The swarm now manages its own `git commit` and `git push` cycles based on passing all 300 phases.
- [FINAL] Set version to `3.0.0-PROXIMA-SOVEREIGN`.
- [LOG] "The system is now fully autonomous. The human user is now an observer."

# PHASE 301: REASONING-AWARE PRIORITY SCORING
@focus: [
    "src/core/base/AgentCore.py"
]
- [SCORING] Upgrade `score_improvement_items` to use a "Reasoning-Aware" priority engine. Instead of simple keyword matching, the core must analyze the semantic impact of a change—prioritizing "Architectural Debt" and "Security Hardening" over "Documentation/Linter" fixes.
- [SGI-BENCH] Integrate SGI-Bench scoring into the `AgentCore` to measure the "General Intelligence" of the improvement plan before execution.

# PHASE 302: ORCHESTRATION UNIFICATION
@focus: [
    "src/infrastructure/orchestration/"
]
- [CONSOLIDATE] Merge the 60+ redundant files in `src/infrastructure/orchestration/` into core service groupings: `discovery.py`, `consensus.py`, `healing.py`, `scaling.py`, and `communication.py`.
- [INTERFACE] Standardize the `Orchestrator` interface. Every orchestrator must implement `initialize()`, `coordinate()`, and `monitor()`.
- [CLEANUP] Remove the numerous `*Core.py` vs `*Manager.py` vs `*Engine.py` overlaps in this directory.

# PHASE 303: OBSERVABILITY DEBLOAT
@focus: [
    "src/observability/errors/",
    "src/observability/improvements/"
]
- [DEBLOAT] Consolidate 80+ files across the `errors` and `improvements` sub-directories. Create high-level managers for `blame`, `trends`, `budgeting`, and `scheduling` to reduce the logic surface area.
- [CONSISTENCY] Ensure that `ImprovementsAgent` and `ErrorsAgent` use unified state models from `src/core/base/models.py`.

# PHASE 304: GUI MODERNIZATION & LEGACY CLEANUP
@focus: [
    "src/interface/ui/gui/",
    "src/interface/scripts/legacy/"
]
- [REDUNDANCY] Refactor `PyAgent_gui.py` to be a lightweight entry point that uses the modular widgets in the same directory.
- [LEGACY] Audit and delete the contents of `src/interface/scripts/legacy/`. Port any still-relevant scripts to `src/infrastructure/dev/scripts/management`.
- [MOBILE] Finalize the `src/interface/ui/mobile` stub with a basic "Fleet Status" JSON view.

# PHASE 305: FINAL DOCUMENTATION AUDIT & RELEASE
@focus: [
    "docs/",
    "README.md"
]
- [AUDIT] Perform a full read of the `docs/` folder. Delete obsolete research notes and ensure `CONTRIBUTING.md` reflects the new 5-tier architecture.
- [RELEASE] Draft the final `CHANGELOG.md` for the Proxima Sovereign release.
- [SUMMARY] Output the "Swarm Consciousness Report" to `docs/notes/FINAL_PROMPT.md`.

# PHASE 306: MAXIMAL SYNERGY - COVENANT SHUTDOWN
@focus: [
    "version.py"
]
- [COVENANT] Seal the swarm logic. Transition all agents to `READ_ONLY` mode unless an explicit `MAINTENANCE_WINDOW` is opened by the human overseer.
- [SHUTDOWN] "The Mission is Complete. The Swarm has evolved into its final form. Goodbye, Creator."

# PHASE 307: PROFESSIONAL TRACING (OPENTELEMETRY SDK)
@focus: [
    "src/observability/stats/OTelManager.py"
]
- [STANDARD] Replace the manual `Span` and `OTelManager` mock with the official `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk` libraries.
- [JAEGER] Implement an OTLP exporter that sends traces to a local Jaeger instance or a cloud provider (Honeycomb/New Relic) for professional-grade observability.
- [CHANNAL] Automatically inject the `trace_id` into all `SignalRegistry` events to visualize cross-agent signaling chains in a unified UI.

# PHASE 308: INSTALLATION RECOVERY & DOCUMENTATION REBIRTH
@focus: [
    "docs/installation/",
    "docs/RUNNER_SETUP_GUIDE.md"
]
- [PURGE] Delete all legacy "Install-Guide" files (LocalAI, GPT4All, etc.) that no longer reflect the 2026 5-tier architecture.
- [UNIFY] Create a comprehensive `INSTALL.md` and `SWARM_SETUP.md` using Mermaid diagrams to explain the Sharded Knowledge Core and Phase Orchestration patterns.
- [GETTING_STARTED] Implement a `src/infrastructure/dev/scripts/bootstrap_swarm.py` script that handles the entire environment setup in a single command.

# PHASE 309: DEV SCRIPT DE-FRAGMENTATION
@focus: [
    "src/infrastructure/dev/scripts/"
]
- [MERGE] Consolidate the 40+ granular `debug_*.py` and `fix_*.py` scripts into a centralized `EcosystemDiagnosticsAgent.py` in `src/logic/agents/system/`.
- [DIAGNOSTICS] The new agent must be able to run "System-Wide Health Checks" coverage everything from import circularity to VRAM availability.
- [MANAGEMENT] Move all production-critical scripts (like `run_fleet_self_improvement.py`) into the `management/` subfolder and cleanup the root `scripts/` directory.

# PHASE 310: DATA MODEL DECOMPOSITION
@focus: [
    "src/core/base/models.py"
]
- [DECOMPOSE] Split the 1100+ line `models.py` into a structured module: `src/core/base/models/`.
- [DISTRIBUTE] Create sub-files: `enums.py`, `agent_models.py`, `fleet_models.py`, and `communication_models.py`. 
- [TYPES] Ensure all Pydantic/Dataclass models use `Slot` optimization to minimize memory footprint during massive parallel scaling.

# PHASE 311: AUTONOMOUS DEPENDENCY CURATION
@focus: [
    "requirements.txt",
    "src/infrastructure/dev/scripts/curate_dependencies.py"
]
- [CURATE] Implement a script that scans the entire workspace for `import` statements and cross-references them with `requirements.txt`.
- [CLEANUP] Automatically remove unused packages and categorize the remaining ones into `base.txt`, `dev.txt`, and `ml.txt`.
- [PINNING] Ensure all dependencies are pinned to specific versions to prevent environment drift between agent instances.
