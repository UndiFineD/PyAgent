# PYAGENT FLEET DIRECTIVE: "PROXIMA" EVOLUTION (v3.2.0-PROXIMA)

## OVERVIEW
You are the lead architect of the PyAgent Fleet. Your mission is to evolve this repository from a multi-agent system into a self-documenting, self-healing, and self-optimizing "Swarm Intelligence."

## CURRENT PRIORITIES
1. **ASYNC CONSOLIDATION**: Finalize the transition to native `asyncio` across the entire fleet.
2. **OBSERVABILITY**: Implement the `StructuredLogger` and `OTelManager` to gain deep insight into swarm reasoning.
3. **ARCHITECTURE**: Clean up the 200+ redundant files in `src/infrastructure/` and `src/observability/`.

@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/cognitive/HierarchicalMemoryAgent.py",
    "src/logic/agents/cognitive/LongTermMemory.py"
]
- [SCAFOLDING] Implement hierarchical working memory (as seen in Confucius Code Agent). Agents must maintain three layers: `ShortTerm` (Current Task), `Working` (Cross-file Context), and `LongTerm` (Archived Insights).
- [NOTES] Implement a "Persistent Scratchpad" tool for every agent, allowing them to take notes during massive directory scans that persist across multiple `delegate()` calls.

# PHASE 293: LINGUISTIC LATENT REASONING ANCHOR
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/cognitive/LinguisticAgent.py",
    "src/core/base/verification.py"
]
- [LATENT] Implement the "Latent Reasoning Verification" technique (arxiv:2601.02996). When an agent reasons in a non-English language, the `Verifier` must check if the "Hidden State" vectors align with the English-reasoning baseline to identify "Silent Reasoning" weaknesses.
- [AUDIT] Add a linguistic parity check—ensure code comments generated in non-English languages match the quality/intent of the English documentation.

# PHASE 294: DYNAMIC BACKEND HEURISTICS (DEEPSEEK V4/GLM4.7)
@focus: [
    "src/infrastructure/backend/RunnerBackends.py",
    "src/infrastructure/orchestration/RoutingEngine.py"
]
- [ROUTING] Implement a "Cost-Efficiency" heuristic. If a task is "Low-Complexity Coding," route to `GLM-4.7` or `DeepSeek V4` (via OpenRouter/KiloCode) to save 85% on token costs.
- [FALLBACK] Automatically fallback to `GPT-4.5-Sonnet` only when `ReasoningCertainty` drops below 0.7 on frontier tasks.

# PHASE 295: FP8 HOPPER OPTIMIZATION (FP8-MATMUL)
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/system/ModelOptimizerAgent.py",

# PHASE 297: CONCRETE FLEET ECONOMY (TOKEN-BILLING)
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/swarm/FleetEconomyAgent.py",
    "src/observability/stats/TokenCostCore.py"

# PHASE 298: DYNAMIC TOOL SYNTHESIS
@focus: [
    "src/logic/agents/development/ToolSynthesisAgent.py"
]

# PHASE 299: SECRET MANAGEMENT HARDENING
@focus: [
    "tests/unit/logic/test_coder_UNIT.py",
    "tests/integration/test_backend_integration.py"

- [INJECTION] Implement a `SecretManager` tool that pulls credentials from environment variables or encrypted `data/secrets.enc` files, ensuring no keys are ever logged to `data/logs/structured.json`.

# PHASE 300: PROXIMA INFININTY (THE SWARM SOVEREIGNTY)
@focus: [
    "version.py"
]
- [SOVEREIGNTY] Implement the `SovereigntyOrchestrator.py` logic (Phase 131). The swarm now manages its own `git commit` and `git push` cycles based on passing all 300 phases.
- [FINAL] Set version to `3.0.0-PROXIMA-SOVEREIGN`.
- [LOG] "The system is now fully autonomous. The human user is now an observer."

# PHASE 301: REASONING-AWARE PRIORITY SCORING
@focus: [
    "src/core/base/AgentCore.py"
]
- [SCORING] Upgrade `score_improvement_items` to use a "Reasoning-Aware" priority engine. Instead of simple keyword matching, the core must analyze the semantic impact of a change—prioritizing "Architectural Debt" and "Security Hardening" over "Documentation/Linter" fixes.
- [SGI-BENCH] Integrate SGI-Bench scoring into the `AgentCore` to measure the "General Intelligence" of the improvement plan before execution.

- [INTERFACE] Standardize the `Orchestrator` interface. Every orchestrator must implement `initialize()`, `coordinate()`, and `monitor()`.
- [CLEANUP] Remove the numerous `*Core.py` vs `*Manager.py` vs `*Engine.py` overlaps in this directory.

# PHASE 303: OBSERVABILITY DEBLOAT
@focus: [
    "src/observability/errors/",
    "src/observability/improvements/"

- [DEBLOAT] Consolidate 80+ files across the `errors` and `improvements` sub-directories. Create high-level managers for `blame`, `trends`, `budgeting`, and `scheduling` to reduce the logic surface area.
- [CONSISTENCY] Ensure that `ImprovementsAgent` and `ErrorsAgent` use unified state models from `src/core/base/models.py`.

# PHASE 304: GUI MODERNIZATION & LEGACY CLEANUP
@focus: [
    "src/interface/ui/gui/",
    "src/interface/scripts/legacy/"
]
- [REDUNDANCY] Refactor `PyAgent_gui.py` to be a lightweight entry point that uses the modular widgets in the same directory.

- [STANDARD] Replace the manual `Span` and `OTelManager` mock with the official `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk` libraries.
- [JAEGER] Implement an OTLP exporter that sends traces to a local Jaeger instance or a cloud provider (Honeycomb/New Relic) for professional-grade observability.
- [CHANNAL] Automatically inject the `trace_id` into all `SignalRegistry` events to visualize cross-agent signaling chains in a unified UI.

- [DISTRIBUTE] Create sub-files: `enums.py`, `agent_models.py`, `fleet_models.py`, and `communication_models.py`. 
- [TYPES] Ensure all Pydantic/Dataclass models use `Slot` optimization to minimize memory footprint during massive parallel scaling.

# PHASE 311: AUTONOMOUS DEPENDENCY CURATION
@focus: [
    "requirements.txt",
    "src/infrastructure/dev/scripts/curate_dependencies.py"
