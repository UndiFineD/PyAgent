# Improvements: `TemplateManager.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Consider documenting class construction / expected invariants.
- Function `apply_template` is missing type annotations.
- Function `get_template_names` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
