To perform maintenance on PytestAgent, the reminder file must be created and updated with maintenance reminders, including a call-to-action ("Review Merge", "AI Integration", and "Log Cleanup") and suggested improvements to tool specificity. The updated content can be generated by running the `generate_reminders()` function in the PytestAgent class, which generates a new reminder file based on the current time stamp.
