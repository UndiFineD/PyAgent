# Improvements: `MultiCloudBridgeOrchestrator.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add a concise module docstring describing purpose / usage.
- Consider using `logging` instead of `print` for controllable verbosity.
- Function `__init__` is missing type annotations.
- Function `register_cloud_node` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
