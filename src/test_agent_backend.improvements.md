# Improvements: `test_agent_backend.py`

## Suggested improvements
- Add explicit tests for non-JSON responses and request timeouts.
- Add tests for cache key normalization and cache eviction behavior (if supported).
- Add negative tests for missing token/base_url configuration.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests/runs.
- File: `src/test_agent_backend.py`
