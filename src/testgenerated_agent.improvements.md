# Improvements: `testgenerated_agent.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add a concise module docstring describing purpose / usage.
- Function `__init__` is missing type annotations.
- Function `perform_specialized_task` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
