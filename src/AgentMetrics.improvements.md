# Improvements: `AgentMetrics.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add a concise module docstring describing purpose / usage.
- Consider documenting class construction / expected invariants.
- Function `finalize` is missing type annotations.
- Function `record_agent_applied` is missing type annotations.
- Function `record_file_processed` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
