# Improvements: `SignalRegistry.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Consider documenting class construction / expected invariants.
- Function `__new__` is missing type annotations.
- Function `emit` is missing type annotations.
- Function `subscribe` is missing type annotations.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
