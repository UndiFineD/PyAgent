Sample Task Module - Automated GUI Click/Type Task

"""

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Import the module and call sample_automated_task() directly, or let
  the PyAgent tool registry invoke it (decorated with @as_tool).
- Requires an active graphical session where pyautogui can control the
  mouse and keyboard; run only on the local desktop with expected
  screen resolution and layout.
- Ensure pyautogui is installed and permits synthetic input (no
  headless servers, remote sessions without input forwarding).

WHAT IT DOES:
- Performs a minimal recorded GUI sequence: moves/clicks to two screen
  coordinates and sends keyboard input ("a" then Enter) between clicks."- Intended as a simplistic example or starting point for automated UI
  interactions and tool wrapping via src.core.base.common.
  base_utilities.as_tool.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Replace hard-coded coordinates and keystrokes with configurable
  parameters or declarative action sequence to avoid brittle behavior
  across different screens and resolutions.
- Add safety checks, delays, and exception handling (e.g., confirm
  active window, verify screen bounds, catch pyautogui.FailSafeException)
  to prevent unintended input or locking the user out.
- Integrate logging, test hooks, and dry-run mode; consider using
  transactional state management (StateTransaction) and asynchronous APIs
  to fit PyAgent architecture and enable retries/rollbacks.

FILE CONTENT SUMMARY:
A sample automated GUI task.
