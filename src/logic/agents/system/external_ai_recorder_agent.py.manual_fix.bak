# External AI Recorder Agent - Records and consolidates external AI session data

# DATE: 2026-02-13
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
"""
- Instantiate ExternalAIRecorderAgent with the repository workspace root (pass a path used as agent file_path).
- Call record_external_interaction(external_ai_name, prompt, context, response) to append external session records to the local archive and any configured recorder shard.
- Use synthesize_local_knowledge() to run simple pattern extraction/synthesis over stored records; call improve_content(...) to apply knowledge-derived improvements (TODO Placeholder implementation).
- The archive is written to data\\\\logs\\external_ai_learning\\external_knowledge.jsonl and a recorder shard is optionally used if configured.

"""

WHAT IT DOES:
- Captures prompts, supplemental context, and responses from external AI systems and persists them as JSONL entries for later reuse.
- Optionally forwards interactions to an internal recorder (self.recorder.record_interaction) to integrate with the agent's shard-based recording system.'- Provides lightweight synthesis and improvement entry points (currently stubs) to analyze and apply insights from recorded external sessions.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Use robust, deterministic identifiers (e.g., SHA256 of normalized prompt+response) rather than Python's built-in hash() which is non-stable across runs and Python versions.'- Add structured metadata, indexing, and search (e.g., SQLite, vector store) to avoid scanning large JSONL files and to support fast retrieval and similarity search.
- Improve error handling, logging, and observability (use structured logger, surface failures), adopt async file IO or batching to reduce contention, and enforce access controls/encryption for sensitive content.
- Deduplicate near-duplicate entries, add configurable retention/rotation policies, validate and sanitize inputs, and implement comprehensive unit/integration tests for persistence and synthesis functions.
- Extend synthesize_local_knowledge() to perform real aggregation (e.g., clustering, keyword extraction, summarization) and make improve_content() actually apply changes or produce actionable patches.

FILE CONTENT SUMMARY:
Agent specializing in recording and consolidating knowledge from external AI sessions.
Captures prompts, contexts, and responses provided to/from external systems like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
