 WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
 Persist the identity registry to durable storage (StateTransaction/agent_state_manager) instead of only in-memory; replace simulated signing with proper cryptographic key pairs and a secure signing/verification flow (Ed25519 or similar) integrated with the SecretManager; add robust DID resolution, revocation and expiration handling, and more granular error handling and logging; include unit tests and type annotations for external interfaces and edge cases.
