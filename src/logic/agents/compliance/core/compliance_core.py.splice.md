# Splice: src/logic/agents/compliance/core/compliance_core.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- ComplianceIssue
- ComplianceCore

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
