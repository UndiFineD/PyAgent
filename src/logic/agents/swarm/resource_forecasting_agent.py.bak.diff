 Replace static, hard-coded predictions with a real forecasting pipeline (time-series models, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, Prophet, or ML-based models). Persist historical usage snapshots to a configurable store and expose async methods that integrate with the system's StateTransaction for safe, atomic file/DB writes. Add configurable horizons, confidence intervals, model training/retraining hooks, model metadata/versioning, input validation, metrics/monitoring, and integration points for autoscalers (actionable APIs rather than static strings). Improve typing (narrow return types), add unit and integration tests, and consider offloading heavy computation to rust_core for performance and to follow the project's Core/Agent separation pattern.
