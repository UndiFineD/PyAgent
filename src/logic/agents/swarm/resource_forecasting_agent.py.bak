"""
Resource Forecasting Agent - Predict Future Resource Needs

# DATE: 2026-02-13
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Import ResourceForecastingAgent from src.core... and instantiate as part of the Tier 3 strategy agents. Use log_usage_snapshot(cpu, memory, tokens) to record periodic telemetry, call predict_future_needs(horizon_hours=int) to retrieve a prediction dictionary, and call get_scaling_recommendation() to receive a simple list of recommended actions. This module is currently a standardized TODO Placeholder and safe to integrate as a stub in higher-level orchestration and testing flows.

WHAT IT DOES:
Provides a minimal Tier 3 (strategy) agent class ResourceForecastingAgent that inherits BaseAgent, records usage snapshots to the log, returns a static prediction payload from predict_future_needs, and returns a small static scaling recommendation list. Initializes with library VERSION and logs that it is a TODO Placeholder implementation for future phases.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
Replace static, hard-coded predictions with a real forecasting pipeline (time-series models, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, Prophet, or ML-based models). Persist historical usage snapshots to a configurable store and expose async methods that integrate with the system's StateTransaction for safe, atomic file/DB writes. Add configurable horizons, confidence intervals, model training/retraining hooks, model metadata/versioning, input validation, metrics/monitoring, and integration points for autoscalers (actionable APIs rather than static strings). Improve typing (narrow return types), add unit and integration tests, and consider offloading heavy computation to rust_core for performance and to follow the project's Core/Agent separation pattern.'
