ChangelogAnalyticsMixin - Calculate changelog statistics and analytics

"""

# DATE: 2026-02-13
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Attach this mixin to an object (agent) that exposes current_content or previous_content and call calculate_statistics() to obtain a metrics dict.

WHAT IT DOES:
Parses a markdown changelog to count semantic/version entries, tally entries by standard categories (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security), extract contributor @handles, and cache results on self._statistics.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
Be more robust in version/date recognition and heading variants, handle multiple sections per category and contributors with non-word characters, compute per-version entry counts and deltas, and tolerate richer markdown/linking formats and internationalization.
