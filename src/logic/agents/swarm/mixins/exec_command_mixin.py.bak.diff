+ExecCommandMixin - Command and Git execution helper
+
+[Brief Summary]
+DATE: 2026-02-13
+AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
+USAGE: Used by OrchestratorAgent (or similar agents) to run subprocess commands, manage per-agent environment variables, run per-file tests and stats updates, and perform simple git commit-and-push operations via an injected command_handler. 
+
+WHAT IT DOES: Provides _run_command (delegates to command_handler.run_command with timeout/retry), _with_agent_env context manager (delegates to command_handler.with_agent_env), run_stats_update (calls agent_stats.py), run_tests (discovers test_{module}.py, executes pytest, logs results) and _commit_and_push (git add/commit/push with basic logging and error handling). 
+
+WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER: Add configurable retry/backoff and richer subprocess capture, improve test discovery and isolation, make git operations idempotent and configurable (remote/branch/author), surface structured errors for callers, and avoid swallowing exceptions; FILE CONTENT SUMMARY omitted for brevity—request the full file block if you need the exact file text.
