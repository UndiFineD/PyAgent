# Splice: src/logic/agents/security/core/red_queen_core.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- AttackVector
- RedQueenCore

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
