# Splice: src/logic/agents/security/immune_response_orchestrator.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- ImmuneResponseOrchestrator
- HoneypotAgent

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
