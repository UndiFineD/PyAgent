# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Provide a single source of truth for system prompts used by the Pentest Agent. Import PentestAgentPrompts and use its attributes (generation_session_init, reasoning_session_init, input_parsing_init, task_description, process_results) to seed LLM conversations for different agent modes (instruction generation, planning/reasoning, parsing, and result processing).

WHAT IT DOES:
Defines a dataclass, PentestAgentPrompts, containing long-form prompt templates that instruct an LLM to behave as an assistant for certified penetration testing in a controlled, educational environment. Each prompt is targeted to a specific agent workflow: session generation, reasoning/task planning, input parsing, concise task description, and processing tester results.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Externalize prompt text into template files or a localization-friendly system to avoid huge in-code strings and to allow parameterization (target IPs, policy flags, token limits).
- Add input-sanitization and explicit safety/legal metadata to avoid misuse and to ensure the model enforces the certified-testing constraints.
- Implement token-length guards, TODO Placeholder substitution for dynamic values, and unit tests validating prompt structure and required separators (e.g., '-----') so downstream parsers remain robust.
