# Security Agent - Security Auditing and Vulnerability detection
# [BATCHFIX] Commented metadata/non-Python
# Brief Summary
# DATE: 2026-02-13
# [BATCHFIX] Commented metadata/non-Python
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
python security_agent.py <path-to-file-or-directory-to-audit>
(or: run as module where create_main_function wraps CLI; pass a single file path to audit)

WHAT IT DOES:
Provides a lightweight agent class, SecurityAgent, that inherits from BaseAgent and is configured with a system prompt tailored for security auditing: it instructs the agent to scan supplied content for vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, insecure dependencies) and to produce remediation steps. It also supplies a minimal default audit report template returned by _get_default_content. The module exposes a simple CLI entrypoint via create_main_function when executed as __main__.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Expand CLI argument parsing to accept directories, recursion depth, output formats (JSON/HTML), severity filtering, and an explicit output path rather than relying solely on the BaseAgent wrapper.
- Integrate static analysis tools (bandit, safety, semgrep) or dependency scanners and aggregate their results into structured findings with normalized severity and CWE identifiers.
- Add secret-detection heuristics, provenance tracing for findings (file/line/snippet), rate-limited network checks for dependency metadata, and unit tests covering detection logic and CLI behavior.
- Improve reporting by including example code fixes, references to CVEs/CWEs, automated patch suggestions, and an option to run non-destructive fixers or generate CI-friendly annotations.
