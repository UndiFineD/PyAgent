Cognitive Super-Agent - Fused Reasoning & Reflection

"""

# DATE: 2026-02-13
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Instantiate with workspace path: agent = CognitiveSuperAgent(rC:\\\\path\\to\\workspace")"- Run synchronous accelerated thinking: output = agent.accelerated_think("Explain X")"- Use async content improvement wrapper: await agent.improve_content("Edit this", target_file="README.md")"
WHAT IT DOES:
- Provides a compact fused agent that exposes an as_tool-wrapped accelerated_think method combining simple "reasoning" and "reflection" steps into a single synchronous call."- Supplies an async improve_content override that delegates to the fused cognitive step to produce text transformations or suggestions.
- Serves as a lightweight high-level orchestrator built on BaseAgent to demonstrate cognitive fusion patterns.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Replace the simulated fused logic with a proper separation between a ReasoningCore and ReflectionCore to follow the Core/Agent separation pattern; make CognitiveSuperAgent orchestrate rather than implement domain logic.
- Make the accelerate pipeline fully asynchronous and non-blocking, use asyncio for I/O and model calls; ensure improve_content performs real file transactions via StateTransaction to guarantee atomic edits.
- Add robust error handling, logging, telemetry/metrics, unit and integration tests, and clear input/output schemas; delegate heavy compute to rust_core where appropriate and preserve CascadeContext for lineage tracking.
