 Replace synthetic SAE mocks with pluggable, auditable interpretability models (or a real sparse autoencoder backend); persist structured events (with schema/versioning) rather than free-form JSONL; support async I/O and concurrency-safe logging; include richer context capture (not truncated summaries), configurable retention/encryption for privacy, and comprehensive unit/integration tests and telemetry for performance and coverage.
