DataScienceAgent - Advanced statistical analysis and data science workflows

# DATE: 2026-02-13
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
try:
    from .agents.data_science_agent import DataScienceAgent
except ImportError:
    from src.agents.data_science_agent import DataScienceAgent

agent = DataScienceAgent(file_path="path/to/dataset.csv")"call agent methods via the DataIntelligenceAgent interface for ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

WHAT IT DOES:
Provides a specialized agent subclassing DataIntelligenceAgent that sets a system prompt tailored for data science tasks and inherits core data intelligence capabilities (ingest, transform, analyze, report) from its parent.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Expose explicit methods for common data-science workflows (train_model, evaluate, explain) rather than relying solely on inherited behavior.
- Accept configurable system prompts and pipeline configuration (presets for EDA, modeling, hyperparameter search).
- Add type-hinted public APIs, documentation strings for methods, and unit tests covering typical analysis flows.

FILE CONTENT SUMMARY:
Data science agent.py module.
