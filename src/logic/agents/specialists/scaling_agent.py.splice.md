# Splice: src/logic/agents/specialists/scaling_agent.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- ProviderType
- ScalingStrategy
- ProviderMetrics
- ScalingDecision
- ScalingAgent

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
