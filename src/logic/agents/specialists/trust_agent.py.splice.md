# Splice: src/logic/agents/specialists/trust_agent.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- Mood
- TrustLevel
- EmotionalState
- TrustMetrics
- TrustAgent

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
