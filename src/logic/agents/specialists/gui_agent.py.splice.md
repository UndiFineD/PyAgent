# Splice: src/logic/agents/specialists/gui_agent.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- Framework
- ElementType
- UIElement
- UIAction
- GUIAgent

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
