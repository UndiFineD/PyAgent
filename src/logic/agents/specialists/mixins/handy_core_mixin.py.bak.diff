-Handy core mixin.py module.
+HandyCoreMixin - Core recording and evaluation.
+
+BRIEF SUMMARY
+DATE: 2026-02-13
+AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
+USAGE: Add HandyCoreMixin to a HandyAgent mixin stack to archive shell interactions via self.recorder and to expose a minimal terminal-oriented evaluation entrypoint; WHAT IT DOES: provides _record(tool_name, input_data, output) that attempts to archive interactions with metadata (phase/type/timestamp/tool) using self.recorder.record_interaction and a simple improve_content(prompt) that returns a static readiness string; WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER: emit richer, structured outputs, support async and transactional recorder usage, surface recorder errors for observability, make metadata configurable, and implement meaningful evaluation logic plus unit tests.
+
+FILE CONTENT SUMMARY: contains an Apache-2.0 header and short module docstring, imports time and typing (TYPE_CHECKING, Any), conditionally imports HandyAgent for typing, and defines class HandyCoreMixin with methods _record(self, tool_name, input_data, output) performing defensive recording when self.recorder is present and improve_content(self, prompt) returning "Handy Agent active. Ready for shell operations."
