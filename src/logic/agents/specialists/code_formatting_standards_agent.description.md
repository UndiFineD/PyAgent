Module docstring (if present):

    Code Formatting Standards Agent for PyAgent.

    This agent enforces strict code formatting standards and quality requirements.
    It is extremely strict on indentation, docstrings, line length, syntax errors,
    naming conventions, whitespace, and final newlines. The agent learns from mistakes
    and prevents common code quality issues.
