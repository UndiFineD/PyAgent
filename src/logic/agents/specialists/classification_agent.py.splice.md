# Splice: src/logic/agents/specialists/classification_agent.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- ClassificationType
- ClassificationResult
- Taxonomy
- ClassificationAgent

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
