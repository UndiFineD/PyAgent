# Improvements: `RunnerBackends.py`

## Suggested improvements

- Add robust subprocess error handling (`check=True`, timeouts, clearer stderr reporting).
- Consider documenting class construction / expected invariants.

## Notes
- These are suggestions based on static inspection; validate behavior with tests / runs.
