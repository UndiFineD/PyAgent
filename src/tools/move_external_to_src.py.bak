"""Move top-level external_candidates into src/external_candidates."""
[Brief Summary]
# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Run from the repository root: python tools/move_external_to_src.py
- Intended to be executed in a git repository where a top-level external_candidates
  directory may contain files to be relocated into src/external_candidates
  while preserving structure.
- Designed for ad-hoc repository maintenance; no arguments currently supported.

WHAT IT DOES:
- Walks the top-level external_candidates directory tree,
  creating matching directories under src/external_candidates.
- Attempts to move each file using git mv (so history is preserved for tracked files);
  falls back to shutil.move when git mv fails or is unavailable.
- Records and prints a summary of moved files and removes empty directories left
  under the original top-level external_candidates.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Provide a dry-run / verbose flag and command-line options to control behavior,
  path prefixes, and to limit moves.
- Better error reporting and logging (currently suppresses most exceptions
  during moves and rmdir).
- Handle filename collisions in destination, preserve file metadata explicitly,
  and optionally commit changes or create a branch when using git operations.
- Validate repository root detection and support running from subdirectories;
  add unit tests and idempotency checks.

FILE CONTENT SUMMARY:
Move files from top-level external_candidates into src/external_candidates.
Tries `git mv` for tracked files, falls back to shutil.move for others.
Preserves directory structure and removes empty source dirs afterwards.
