# Description: src/core/base/logic/core/cuda_stream_pool.py

Module docstring (if present):

    CudaStreamPool - CUDA stream and event management with pooling.

    This module provides efficient stream and event pooling for GPU operations,
    enabling better overlap of compute and communication.

    Inspired by vLLM's stream management, but extends with:
    - Priority stream hints for latency-critical operations
    - Automatic cleanup on pool destruction
    - Stream affinity for related operations
    - Event recycling to reduce allocation overhead

    Example:
        >>> pool = CudaStreamPool(compute_streams=4, comm_streams=2)
        >>> with pool.acquire_compute() as stream:
        ...     result = model(input, stream=stream)
        >>> pool.sync_all()

Top-level members:
- Classes: StreamPriority, StreamState, StreamStats, PooledStream, PooledEvent, EventPool, CudaStreamPool
- Functions: get_global_stream_pool, reset_global_pool, compute_stream, comm_stream, high_priority_stream
