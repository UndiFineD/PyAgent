# Description: src/core/base/logic/structures/uva_buffer_pool.py

Module docstring (if present):

    UvaBufferPool - Zero-copy GPU transfers via Unified Virtual Addressing.

    This module implements UVA (Unified Virtual Addressing) buffer management
    for efficient CPU-GPU data transfers without intermediate copies.

    Inspired by vLLM v1/worker/gpu/buffer_utils.py, but extends with:
    - Adaptive pool sizing based on access patterns
    - Priority-aware buffer allocation
    - Memory pressure monitoring
    - Automatic buffer promotion/demotion

    Example:
        >>> pool = UvaBufferPool(buffer_count=4, buffer_size=1024*1024)
        >>> buffer = pool.acquire()
        >>> buffer.copy_to_uva(cpu_tensor)  # Zero-copy to GPU-visible memory
        >>> buffer.copy_to_gpu(cuda_stream)  # DMA transfer to GPU
        >>> pool.release(buffer)

Top-level members:
- Classes: BufferState, AllocationStrategy, BufferStats, UvaBuffer, UvaBufferPool, UvaBackedTensor
- Functions: create_uva_buffer, create_uva_pool
