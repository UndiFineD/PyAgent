# Description: src/core/base/logic/structures/flat_logprobs.py

Module docstring (if present):

    FlatLogprobs - Memory-efficient flat storage for token log probabilities.

    Inspired by vLLM's FlatLogprobs pattern for reduced GC overhead compared
    to list[dict[int, Logprob]] by flattening into primitive type arrays.
