# Description: src/core/base/common/utils/hash_registry.py

Module docstring (if present):

    HashRegistry - Unified hashing utilities with multiple backends.

    Inspired by vLLM's hashing.py patterns for flexible hash function selection.

    Supports:
    - SHA-256 (cryptographic, FIPS-compliant)
    - MD5 (fast, non-cryptographic)
    - xxHash (fastest, non-cryptographic)
    - FNV-1a (Rust-native fast hash)
    - Safe hash (auto-selects based on environment)

    Phase 17: vLLM Pattern Integration (P2)

Top-level members:
- Classes: HashAlgorithm, ContentHasher
- Functions: _is_fips_mode, is_fips_mode, hash_sha256, hash_sha1, hash_md5, hash_xxhash64, hash_xxhash128, _fnv1a_hash, hash_fnv1a, safe_hash
