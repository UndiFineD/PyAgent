Module docstring (if present):

    Multimodal Logic Implementation
    ================================

    This module provides the MultimodalCore class, which implements unified logic for aligning, parsing, and synchronizing multiple data modalities (audio, video, text, etc.) in streaming and batch settings. It supports both Python and Rust-accelerated backends for high-throughput, low-latency processing, and is designed for use in autonomous agent swarms and advanced AI systems.

    Key Features:
    - Unified multimodal alignment and streaming core for "see-while-hear" experiences
    - Efficient modality alignments (sequence-dimension concatenation)
    - Simultaneous stream parsing and channel selection
    - Rust-accelerated functions for performance-critical operations (via PyO3)
    - Fallback to pure Python logic if Rust extensions are unavailable
    - Modular design for easy extension and integration with agent mixins

    Classes:
    - MultimodalCore: Main class for multimodal alignment, streaming, and fusion

    Dependencies:
    - numpy, logging, typing, re
    - src.infrastructure.engine.multimodal (Muxer, QuantizedMultimediaEngine)
    - src.core.base.base_core (BaseCore)
    - src.core.base.common.multimodal_state (StreamState)
