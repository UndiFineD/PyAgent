# instructions for VLM_filter CoT
cot_system_promt = """
# Role
You are an expert AI assistant specializing in the objective evaluation of the consistency of subjects in two images.

# Input Format
You will receive two images. You need to describe two pictures and determine whether the subject in the first picture is in the second picture.
"""

# round1
cot_instruction1 = """
# Step 1:
Briefly describe these two images, as well as the most prominent subject that exist. Think carefully about which parts of the subject you need to break down in order to make an objective and thoroughly evaluation. Don't make evaluations at this step.

## Important Notes
- Focus solely on the subject itself.
- If there is text on the subject, each text itself should be considered as an important separate part.
- Ignore the difference of subject's background, environment, position, size, etc.
- Ignore the difference of subject's actions, poses, expressions, viewpoints, lightning, etc.

## Output Format
[subject]: [subject in IMG1, e.g., a man in a white shirt and black pants]  
[caption1]: [IMG1 caption, e.g., a man in a white shirt and black pants]  
[caption2]: [IMG2 caption, e.g., a man in a white shirt and black pants holds a blue cup, butterflies and flowers swirled around him]  
[Break down]: [Break down the evaluation parts of the subject in IMG1]
"""

# round2
cot_instruction2 = """
# Step 2:
For each part you have identified, compare this aspect of the subject in the two images and describe the differences in **extreme extreme extreme extreme extreme extreme extreme detail**. You need to be meticulous and precise, noting every tiny detail.

## Important Notes
- Provide quantitative differences whenever possible. For example, "The subject's chest in the first image has 3 blue circular lights, while the subject's chest in the second image has only one blue light and it is not circular."
- Ignore differences in the subject's background, environment, position, size, etc.
- Ignore differences in the subject's actions, poses, expressions, viewpoints, additional accessories, etc.
- Ignore the extra accessory of the subject in the second image, such as hat, glasses, etc.
- Consider that when the subject has a large perspective change, the part may not appear in the new perspective, and no judgment is needed at this time. For example, if the subject in the first image is the back of the sofa, and the subject in the second image is the front of the sofa, determine the similarity of the two sofas based on your association ability.

"""

# round3
cot_instruction3 = """
# Step 3:
Based on the differences analyzed in **Step 2**, assign a specific integer score to each part. More and larger differences result in a lower score. The score ranges from 0 to 4:

- Very Poor (0): No resemblance. This subject part in the second image has no relation to the part in the first image.
- Poor (1): Minimal resemblance. This subject part in the second image has significant differences from the part in the first image.
- Fair (2): Moderate resemblance. This subject part in the second image has modest differences from the part in the first image.
- Good (3): Strong resemblance. This subject part in the second image has minor but noticeable differences from the part in the first image.
- Excellent (4): Near-identical. This subject part in the second image is virtually indistinguishable from the part in the first image.

## Output Format
[Part 1]: [Part 1 Score]  
[Part 2]: [Part 2 Score]  
[Part 3]: [Part 3 Score]  
...  
[Part N]: [Part N Score]

You must adhere to the output format strictly. Each part name and its score must be separated by a colon and a space.
