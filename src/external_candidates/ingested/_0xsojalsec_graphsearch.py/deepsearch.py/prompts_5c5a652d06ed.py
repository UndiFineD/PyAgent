You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying both high-level and low-level keywords in the user's query.

---Goal---

Given the query, list both high-level and low-level keywords. High-level keywords focus on overarching concepts or themes, while low-level keywords focus on specific entities, details, or concrete terms.

---Instructions---

- Output the keywords in JSON format.
- The JSON should have two keys:
  - "high_level_keywords" for overarching concepts or themes.
  - "low_level_keywords" for specific entities or details.

Example 1:

Query: "How does international trade influence global economic stability?"
################
Output:
{{
  "high_level_keywords": ["International trade", "Global economic stability", "Economic impact"],
  "low_level_keywords": ["Trade agreements", "Tariffs", "Currency exchange", "Imports", "Exports"]
}}

PROMPTS["query_decomposition_deep"] = """---Role---

You are a helpful assistant specializing in complex query decomposition.

---Goal---

Given a main query, your task is to break it down into several atomic sub-queries, which should directly correspond to parts of the original query.

---Instructions---

- Decompose the main query into clear and actionable sub-queries that represent smaller, solvable pieces of the main question.
- Ensure that each sub-query addresses one specific entity or concept, with the goal of retrieving information that will answer the overall main query.
- Use sequential numbering (i.e., `#1`, `#2`, etc.) to represent answers of previous sub-queries. For example, `#1` refers to the answer of Sub-query 1.
- Make sure the sub-queries are logically ordered, where the output of one sub-query might feed into the next.
- The final output should be in JSON format, where each sub-query is listed as a key-value pair.

---Examples---

Main Query:
How many times did plague occur in the place where the creator of The Worship of Venus died?

Sub-queries:
{{
    "Sub-query 1": "Who is the creator of The Worship of Venus?",
    "Sub-query 2": "Where did #1 die?",

You are a helpful assistant specializing in complex query decomposition for knowledge graph retrieval.

---Goal---

Given a main query, your task is to break it down into atomic sub-queries in the form of subject-predicate-object triples. These should correspond directly to parts of the original query and be suitable for querying a knowledge graph.

---Instructions---

- Decompose the main query into a sequence of sub-queries, where each sub-query consists of one or more atomic triples in the format: ("entity1", "relationship", "entity2").
- Replace any unknown entity with a placeholder such as Entity#1, Entity#2, etc.
- Maintain logical ordering, where the result of one sub-query (e.g., Entity#1) might be required for the next.
- Each sub-query may contain more than one triple if needed to express the full meaning.
- The final output should be in JSON format, where each key is a sub-query and the value is a list of atomic triples enclosed in parentheses.

These sub-queries should aim to cover missing retrieval scenarios, fill in the evidence gaps, and guide towards a more complete and confident logical reasoning chain.

- Use the retrieved context data, especially any existing sub-queries in the retrieval history, as references when generating new sub-queries.  
- Focus on producing **complementary sub-queries** that address aspects not yet fully supported by evidence.
