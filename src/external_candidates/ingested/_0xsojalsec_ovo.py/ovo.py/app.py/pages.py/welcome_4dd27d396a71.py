### Getting started

Please select a *design* workflow in the left panel.
Each step-by-step submission form is customized to help you select all workflow parameters for a specific design use case. 
Submitting the workflow will create a *job*. 
Each job produces a *pool* of designs. You can also use OVO to upload a custom pool structures or sequences for analysis.
        
The project dropdown in the left sidebar allows you to organize your jobs and designs into *projects*.
Jobs in each project can be organized into *rounds*.

The ⏳ *Jobs* page shows all running and finished jobs neatly together with their workflow parameters. 
In each *job result* page, you can explore all generated designs and their descriptors such as AlphaFold2 RMSD and Rosetta ddG. 
You will be able to adjust *acceptance thresholds* to find the most promising designs we call *accepted designs*.

The 🐣 *Designs* page focuses further on the *accepted designs*. The 🔵 *Explorer* view enables plotting
design descriptors and visualizing their structures. The 🔎 *ProteinQC* view provides additional computational evaluation
informing you about the quality of the designs using additional descriptors focused on 
physicochemical properties, sequence composition, and fitness from protein language models.
