SlashCommands - Chat prompt slash command parser and executor

"""

[Brief Summary]
A lightweight backward-compatibility shim that re-exports the relocated SlashCommands implementation from src/interface/commands so existing imports continue to work without changes. Keeps API surface stable while the real implementation lives elsewhere.

DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Import the compatibility module where older code expects it, or prefer the new path src.interface.commands for new code:
from <package>.slash_commands import SlashCommands, parse_commands, register_command
or
try:
    from .interface.commands import SlashCommands # preferred
except ImportError:
    from src.interface.commands import SlashCommands # preferred


WHAT IT DOES:
- Re-exports classes, functions, and decorators from the moved implementation to preserve backward compatibility.
- Documents the intended location of the real implementation (src/interface/commands/) and centralizes the public API via __all__.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Emit a deprecation notice on import that points users to the new module path and the migration timeline.
- Use lazy imports to avoid import-time side effects and reduce startup cost for consumers that only need small parts of the API.
- Add type annotations and inline documentation linking to the new source; include unit tests that verify the compatibility surface.
- Validate __all__ completeness periodically and consider automated tests that ensure exports remain in sync after refactors.

FILE CONTENT SUMMARY:
SlashCommands - Chat prompt slash command parser and executor.

Provides backward compatibility for the moved SlashCommands implementation.
Moved to src/interface/commands/
