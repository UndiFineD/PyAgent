# Description: src/infrastructure/compute/cuda/cudagraph_dispatcher.py

Module docstring (if present):

    CudagraphDispatcher - Dispatch logic for CUDA graph execution.

    Implements vLLM's CudagraphDispatcher patterns for:
    - Graph selection based on batch descriptors
    - Fallback to eager execution
    - Piecewise vs full graph dispatch
    - Thread-safe graph management

    Beyond vLLM:
    - Predictive graph selection
    - Multi-stream dispatch
    - Composite graph support

Top-level members:
- Classes: DispatchMode, DispatchKey, DispatchStats, DispatchPolicy, DefaultDispatchPolicy, AdaptiveDispatchPolicy, GraphEntry, CudagraphDispatcher, CompositeDispatcher, StreamDispatcher
- Functions: create_dispatch_key, get_padded_key
