# Description: src/infrastructure/compute/cuda/u_batch_processor.py

Module docstring (if present):

    UBatchProcessor - Micro-batch processing for CUDA graph efficiency.

    Implements vLLM's UBatchWrapper patterns for efficient GPU utilization:
    - UBatchContext: Execution context for micro-batches
    - UbatchMetadata: Sliced inputs for each micro-batch
    - UBatchWrapper: Thread-coordinated micro-batch execution
    - Barrier synchronization across threads

    Beyond vLLM:
    - Dynamic ubatch sizing based on memory pressure
    - Adaptive thread pool sizing
    - Overlap optimization for compute/transfer

Top-level members:
- Classes: UBatchState, UBatchSlice, UBatchContext, UbatchMetadata, UBatchConfig, UBatchBarrier, UBatchWrapper, DynamicUBatchWrapper
- Functions: make_ubatch_contexts
