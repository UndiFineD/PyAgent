# Description: src/infrastructure/__init__.py

Module docstring (if present):

    Infrastructure layer for PyAgent, handling core system utilities and services.

    This module uses lazy loading via __getattr__ to defer imports of expensive
    modules until they are first accessed. This significantly improves startup time.

    Lazily loaded modules:
        - EagleProposer: EAGLE-style speculative decoding
        - ARCOffloadManager: ARC cache eviction with ghost lists
        - ToolParserRegistry: Model-specific tool parsing
        - ReasoningEngine: Unified thinking and tool extraction
        - PagedAttentionEngine: Paged attention for memory efficiency

    Example:
        from src.infrastructure import EagleProposer  # Not loaded until accessed
        proposer = EagleProposer(config)  # Now the module is imported

Top-level members:
- Functions: __getattr__, __dir__
