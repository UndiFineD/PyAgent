# Description: src/infrastructure/engine/outputs/logprobs_processor.py

Module docstring (if present):

    Phase 45: Logprobs Tensors and Lists
    vLLM-inspired logprobs data structures with optimized handling.

    Beyond vLLM:
    - Async CPU transfer with double buffering
    - Compressed storage for sparse logprobs
    - Streaming logprobs support
    - Batch aggregation optimizations

Top-level members:
- Classes: TokenLogprob, TopLogprobs, LogprobsLists, LogprobsTensors, AsyncCPUTransfer, SamplerOutput, ModelRunnerOutput, StreamingLogprobsCollector
- Functions: extract_top_k_logprobs_rust, batch_logprobs_to_cpu_rust
