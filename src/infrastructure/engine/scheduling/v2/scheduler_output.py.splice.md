# Splice: src/infrastructure/engine/scheduling/v2/scheduler_output.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- ScheduledSequence
- SchedulerOutput

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
