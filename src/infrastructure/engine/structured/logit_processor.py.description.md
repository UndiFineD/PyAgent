# Description: src/infrastructure/engine/structured/logit_processor.py

Module docstring (if present):

    LogitProcessor: Token-level constraint application during generation.

    Provides:
    - Bitmask-based logit masking
    - Composite processors for multiple constraints
    - Logit bias injection
    - Temperature/top-p/top-k integration

Top-level members:
