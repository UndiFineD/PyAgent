Suggested improvements (automatically generated):
- Add unit tests covering core behavior and edge cases.
- Break large modules into smaller, testable components.
- Avoid heavy imports at module import time; import lazily where appropriate.
- Add type hints and explicit return types for public functions.
- Add logging and better error handling for file and IO operations.
- Consider dependency injection for filesystem and environment interactions.
