# Splice: src/infrastructure/swarm/fleet/core/gpu_monitor_core.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- GPUMetrics
- GPUMonitorCore

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
