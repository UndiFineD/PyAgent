# Description: src/infrastructure/swarm/worker/disaggregated_prefill_worker.py

Module docstring (if present):

    Disaggregated Prefill Worker.

    This module implements a specialized worker for the prefill stage of disaggregated inference.
    In a disaggregated architecture, prefill workers focus on processing the input prompt and
    generating the initial KV cache, which is then transferred to decode-only workers.

    Optimized for:
    - High compute throughput during prompt processing
    - Efficient KV cache generation and serialization
    - Background asynchronous transfer of KV blocks to remote consumers
    - Massive context length handling through chunked prefill

    Inspired by vLLM's specialized worker architectures.
