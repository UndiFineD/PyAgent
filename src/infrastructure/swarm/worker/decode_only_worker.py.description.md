# Description: src/infrastructure/swarm/worker/decode_only_worker.py

Module docstring (if present):

    Decode-Only Worker.

    This module implements a specialized worker for the decode stage of disaggregated inference.
    Decode-only workers receive KV cache from prefill workers and perform low-latency,
    autoregressive token generation.

    Optimized for:
    - Low-latency token-by-token generation
    - Efficient incremental KV cache loading from remote producers
    - Minimal memory footprint (swapping unused KV blocks to remote storage)
    - High concurrency for many concurrent sequences

    Inspired by vLLM's specialized worker architectures and disaggregated prefill-decode patterns.
