# Description: src/infrastructure/storage/serialization/zero_copy_serializer.py

Module docstring (if present):

    ZeroCopySerializer - Zero-copy msgpack serialization for tensors and arrays.

    Implements vLLM's v1 serialization pattern for efficient tensor transfer
    without copying data. Uses auxiliary buffers for large tensors to avoid
    memory copies in ZMQ multipart messages.

    Phase 23: Advanced Serialization & Validation

Top-level members:
- Classes: ZeroCopyEncoder, ZeroCopyDecoder
- Functions: encode_with_buffers, decode_with_buffers, _str_to_torch_dtype, _torch_dtype_to_numpy, _is_torch_tensor, _is_torch_type
