# Description: src/infrastructure/storage/kv_transfer/pipeline_parallel_transfer.py

Module docstring (if present):

    Pipeline-Parallel Aware KV Transfer.

    This module provides orchestration for KV cache transfers when Pipeline Parallelism (PP)
    is enabled. In PP scenarios, different layers of the model reside on different pipeline
    stages (processes/nodes). KV transfer must be coordinated such that each stage's
    respective KV blocks are transferred to the correct corresponding stages in the
    destination (prefill -> decode) group.

    Key Patterns:
    - Stage-to-stage mapping for disaggregated PP
    - Synchronized collective transfers for KV metadata
    - Latency hiding by overlapping PP stage transfers
    - Rust-accelerated PP stage mapping logic
