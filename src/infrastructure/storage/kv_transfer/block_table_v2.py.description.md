    BlockTableV2: Enhanced Block Table Management

    Provides efficient block table management for KV cache with
    hybrid block sizes, slot mapping, and distributed support.

    Key Features Beyond vLLM:
    - Dynamic block size adaptation
    - Compressed slot mappings
    - Multi-GPU block coordination
    - Predictive block allocation
    - Memory-efficient sparse tables

    Based on vLLM v1 patterns with PyAgent innovations.
