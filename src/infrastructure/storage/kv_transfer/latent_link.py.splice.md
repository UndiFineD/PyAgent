# Splice: src/infrastructure/storage/kv_transfer/latent_link.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- SynapticAdapter
- LatentLinkManager
- SynapticLink

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
