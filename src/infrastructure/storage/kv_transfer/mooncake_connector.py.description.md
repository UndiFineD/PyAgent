# Description: src/infrastructure/storage/kv_transfer/mooncake_connector.py

Module docstring (if present):

    Mooncake KV Transfer Connector.

    This module implements the Mooncake-style KV transfer protocol for datacenter-scale inference.
    Mooncake is a KVCache-centric disaggregated inference architecture that separates prefill
    and decode nodes, using a distributed KV cache system as a shared buffer.

    Inspired by the "Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Low-latency LLM Serving System"
    research and vLLM's implementation patterns.

    Key Features:
    - Distributed KV cache orchestration
    - Asynchronous RDMA-based (simulated/pluggable) transfers
    - Metadata-driven routing for prefill-to-decode handover
    - Support for chunked prefill and incremental loading
    - Rust-accelerated buffer management
