# Description: src/infrastructure/storage/memory/gpu_memory_allocator.py

Module docstring (if present):

    GPUMemoryAllocator: GPU memory optimization with sleep/wake and pooling.

    vLLM Pattern: CuMemAllocator from v1/core/gpu_memory/cumem.py
    - sleep() / wake_up() for GPU memory sharing
    - use_memory_pool() context manager
    - MemorySnapshot for state capture/restore

    Beyond vLLM:
    - Multi-GPU memory balancing
    - Memory pressure detection and response
    - Automatic fragmentation management

Top-level members:
- Classes: MemoryState, AllocationStrategy, MemoryRegion, MemorySnapshot, MemoryPoolConfig, MemoryPressureEvent, CuMemAllocator, MultiGPUMemoryBalancer
