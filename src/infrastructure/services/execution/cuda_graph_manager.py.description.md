# Description: src/infrastructure/services/execution/cuda_graph_manager.py

Module docstring (if present):

    CUDAGraphManager - Graph capture and replay for reduced kernel launch overhead.

    Implements vLLM's CUDA graph patterns for efficient GPU execution:
    - CUDAGraphEntry: Captured graph with metadata
    - CUDAGraphKey: Batch size + flags hashing
    - CUDAGraphManager: Capture/lookup/replay operations

    Beyond vLLM: LRU eviction for memory pressure management.

Top-level members:
- Classes: CUDAGraphMode, BatchDescriptor, CUDAGraphEntry, CUDAGraphRegistry, CUDAGraphManager
- Functions: compute_graph_key, generate_warmup_sizes
