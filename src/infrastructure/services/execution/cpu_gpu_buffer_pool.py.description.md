# Description: src/infrastructure/services/execution/cpu_gpu_buffer_pool.py

Module docstring (if present):

    CpuGpuBufferPool.py - Paired CPU/GPU tensor buffers.

    Inspired by vLLM's v1/worker/gpu/buffer_utils.py. Provides unified
    buffer management for CPU/GPU memory with efficient pinned memory
    transfers.

    Phase 29: Execution Context, Batching & Async Streaming
