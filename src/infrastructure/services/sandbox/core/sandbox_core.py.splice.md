# Splice: src/infrastructure/services/sandbox/core/sandbox_core.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- SandboxConfig
- SandboxCore

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
