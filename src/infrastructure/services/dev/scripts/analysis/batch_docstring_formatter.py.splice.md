# Splice: src/infrastructure/services/dev/scripts/analysis/batch_docstring_formatter.py

This module contains multiple top-level classes/functions which could be split into separate modules:

- DocstringStandards
- DocstringAnalyzer
- DocstringFixer

Suggested split:
- Separate data models, core logic, and helpers into their own modules to improve testability.
