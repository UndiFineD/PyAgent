# Description: src/infrastructure/services/resilience/circuit_breaker.py

Module docstring (if present):

    CircuitBreaker - Resilience pattern for failing gracefully.

    Goes beyond vLLM with production-grade circuit breaker implementation
    for protecting against cascading failures in distributed systems.

    States:
    - CLOSED: Normal operation, requests flow through
    - OPEN: Failures exceeded threshold, requests rejected immediately
    - HALF_OPEN: Testing if service recovered with limited requests

    Phase 18: Beyond vLLM - Resilience Patterns

Top-level members:
- Classes: CircuitState, CircuitStats, CircuitBreakerError, CircuitBreaker, CircuitBreakerRegistry
- Functions: circuit_breaker, get_circuit_stats, get_all_circuit_stats
