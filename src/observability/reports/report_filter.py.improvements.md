# Improvements: src/observability/reports/report_filter.py

Potential improvements:
- Add unit tests for filtering logic across combinations of criteria.
- Support more complex boolean filters (AND/OR), and negation for categories.
- Allow filtering by filename, line ranges, and function names.
- Support configurable default `FilterCriteria` via dependency injection.
