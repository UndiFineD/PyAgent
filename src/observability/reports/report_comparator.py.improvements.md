# Improvements: src/observability/reports/report_comparator.py

Potential improvements:
- Add unit tests that compare real report snippets and verify reported diffs.
- Improve diff detection to handle markdown variations and ignore ordering when appropriate.
- Provide options to produce unified diffs or side-by-side comparisons as output.
