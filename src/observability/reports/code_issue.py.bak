CodeIssue - Data model for a single code issue

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Instantiate CodeIssue to represent a detected problem or suggestion, e.g. CodeIssue("naming inconsistent", IssueCategory.STYLE, SeverityLevel.MINOR, line_number=42, file_path="src/foo.py", function_name="bar")."
WHAT IT DOES:
Provides a simple dataclass capturing message, category, severity and optional location/context for a code issue.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
Add validation, richer metadata (module, commit, rule_id), and methods to serialize/compare/format output for reports and triage.
