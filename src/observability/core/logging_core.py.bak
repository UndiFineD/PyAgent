Logging Core - Sensitive log masking and RFC3339 timestamp formatting

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Instantiate LoggingCore(custom_patterns=None). 
Use mask_text(text) to redact sensitive tokens in log lines 
(falls back to a Rust accelerator when available and no custom patterns are used). 
Use format_rfc3339(timestamp_ms) to produce an RFC3339-like ISO timestamp string 
from milliseconds since epoch.

WHAT IT DOES:
Provides pure-Python logic for masking sensitive tokens in arbitrary text 
using a set of compiled regular expressions (with a small default set for OpenAI, 
Bearer/JWT-like tokens, and GitHub tokens). 
When rust_core is importable and no custom_patterns were provided, 
it delegates masking to rust_core.mask_sensitive_logs for higher throughput; 
otherwise it applies compiled regex substitutions in Python. 
Also includes a convenience static method to format millisecond timestamps 
to an RFC3339-style ISO string for logging output.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Validate and document timezone handling in format_rfc3339 
(current code references datetime.UTC which is non-standard; 
using datetime.timezone.utc would be more robust and portable).  
- Allow configurable redaction token and per-pattern replacement strategies 
instead of hard-coded "[REDACTED]"."- Expose pattern compilation options (flags like re.IGNORECASE) 
and better escaping guidance for user-supplied patterns.  
- Add unit tests for rust fallback, custom pattern behavior, 
and edge cases (very large logs, overlapping patterns, binary/Unicode inputs).  
- Provide streaming-safe APIs (e.g., incremental masking) 
and an option to return masked spans/positions for downstream structured logging.
