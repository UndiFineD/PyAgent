Branch Comparer - Comparing errors across git branches

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Instantiate BranchComparer, call set_branch_errors(branch, error_ids) for each branch, 
then use compare(branch_a, branch_b) or the helpers get_new_errors(base_branch, feature_branch) 
and get_fixed_errors(base_branch, feature_branch).

WHAT IT DOES:
Provides a lightweight in-memory facility to record sets of error IDs per branch 
and compute differences: errors only in A, only in B, and common errors. 
Returns a BranchComparison dataclass-like object with those lists.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Validate inputs and raise clear exceptions for unknown branches 
instead of silently treating them as empty sets.
- Preserve deterministic ordering (e.g., sort returned lists) 
and maintain original error metadata rather than just IDs.
- Add docstring examples, logging, and unit tests covering edge cases 
(empty branches, identical branches, large sets), and consider streaming/async 
interfaces for large datasets.
