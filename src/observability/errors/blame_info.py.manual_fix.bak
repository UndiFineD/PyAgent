BlameInfo - Git blame container

"""

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Provide a simple dataclass carrying git blame details for an error, import and instantiate BlameInfo with error_id and optional commit fields

WHAT IT DOES:
Encapsulates minimal blame metadata (commit hash, author, date, message) associated with an error identifier

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
Add validation, typing constraints, parsing helpers to construct from `git blame` or commit objects, and serialization methods (to_dict/from_dict)

FILE CONTENT SUMMARY:
Auto-extracted class from agent_errors.py

    from dataclasses import dataclass
