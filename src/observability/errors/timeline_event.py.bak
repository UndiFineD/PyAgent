"""
TimelineEvent - Simple dataclass for error timeline entries

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
try:
    from .core.base.lifecycle.timeline_event import TimelineEvent
except ImportError:
    from src.core.base.lifecycle.timeline_event import TimelineEvent

event = TimelineEvent(timestamp="2026-02-12T21:00:00Z", event_type="created", error_id="err-1234", details="Initial occurrence")"
WHAT IT DOES:
Defines a minimal dataclass representing a point in an error timeline with fields timestamp, event_type, error_id, and optional details and exposes module __version__ from the package VERSION

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
Use timezone-aware datetime objects instead of plain strings, validate and normalize timestamps, replace event_type strings with an Enum, add serialization/deserialization helpers, add unit tests and richer docstrings
