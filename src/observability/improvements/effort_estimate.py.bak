EffortEstimate - Enum of effort estimation levels

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Import the enum and use values to annotate or compute effort estimates in planners or task scoring:
  from src.core.base import effort_estimate
  from src.core.base.effort_estimate import EffortEstimate
  estimate = EffortEstimate.MEDIUM

WHAT IT DOES:
- Defines a small, Fibonacci-like set of named effort levels (TRIVIAL, SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EPIC) for consistent effort tagging across agents and tooling

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Add docstrings per-member or metadata (time range, relative weight), provide integer-to-duration mapping helpers, input validation and utility methods for arithmetic/comparison, and unit tests and type hints for stronger integration
