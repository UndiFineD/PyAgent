Progress Report - ProgressReport dataclass for improvements dashboard

"""

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Import the dataclass and instantiate with report_date and counts:
  from src.interface.models.progress_report import ProgressReport
  report = ProgressReport(report_date="2026-02-12", completed_count=5, in_progress_count=2, velocity=1.5)"- Use .burndown_data for charting libraries (list[tuple[str,int]] of date and remaining work).

WHAT IT DOES:
- Provides a compact, type-annotated dataclass representing a progress report for the improvements dashboard, including counts, velocity and burndown series; versioned via src.core.base.lifecycle.version.VERSION.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Validate types/values (e.g., non-negative counts, ISO date parsing) and expose methods to compute derived metrics (week-over-week velocity, completion rate).
- Replace bare list[tuple[str,int]] with a typed NamedTuple or small value class for burndown points and add serialization helpers (to_dict/from_dict) and JSON schema for API compatibility.
- Add unit tests for edge cases and integrate timezone-aware dates.
