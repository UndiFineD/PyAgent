validation_severity.py - ValidationSeverity enum# DATE: 2026-02-12# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
try:
    from .core.base.validation_severity import ValidationSeverity
except ImportError:
    from src.core.base.validation_severity import ValidationSeverity

# compare severity
if ValidationSeverity.ERROR == ValidationSeverity.WARNING:
    ...
# serialize
value = ValidationSeverity.INFO.value

WHAT IT DOES:
Defines a small Enum describing validation issue severities (ERROR, WARNING, INFO) and exposes module version from core lifecycle.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
Add richer documentation, canonical serialization/deserialization helpers, mapping to HTTP/log levels, and unit tests; consider attaching numeric priorities and ordering methods for comparisons.
