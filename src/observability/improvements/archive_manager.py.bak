ArchiveManager - Archives completed improvements

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Instantiate ArchiveManager(), call .archive(improvement) to add an Improvement to the archive, and call .restore(improvement_id) to remove and return a previously archived Improvement by its id. 
- Expect KeyError if restore is called with a missing id.

WHAT IT DOES:
- Maintains an in-memory list of archived Improvement objects.
- Provides simple append-based archival and linear-search restoration by improvement.id.
- Keeps behavior intentionally minimal and synchronous for straightforward use within agent workflows.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Persist archives to durable storage (file, database, or StateTransaction) to survive process restarts.
- Use an index (dict) or ordered mapping to avoid O(n) restore performance and to support faster lookups and removals.
- Add thread-safety or async-safe primitives (locks or asyncio primitives) for concurrent use in multi-agent contexts.
- Provide metadata (timestamps, actor, reason) and soft-delete / purge policies, plus search/listing and size limits.
- Validate inputs and return clearer exceptions or typed results rather than raw KeyError for better error handling.
