"""
Analytics Engine - Recording completions and computing simple trends

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
Used by tests and simple workflows to record completed Improvement objects and to retrieve a completion trend or compute sprint velocity

WHAT IT DOES:
Stores completed Improvement instances in-memory; returns a CompletionTrend with total_completed; calculates velocity by summing story_points and normalizing to weeks based on sprint_days

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
Persist recorded completions or accept an external datastore; respect timestamps and filter by period_days when computing trends; validate inputs and handle edge cases (zero or negative sprint_days); expose more analytics (rolling averages, median cycle time, per-agent breakdown); add type-checked interfaces and richer tests

FILE CONTENT SUMMARY:
Auto-extracted class from agent_improvements.py
