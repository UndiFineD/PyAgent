[ImprovementDiffType] - [Defines ImprovementDiffType enum]

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Import ImprovementDiffType to classify change kinds when comparing improvement entries between branches (ADDED, REMOVED, MODIFIED, UNCHANGED).

WHAT IT DOES:
- Provides a small, explicit Enum for categorizing improvement diffs across branches to make comparison logic readable and type-safe.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Add docstrings and type hints where used, include utility methods (e.g., from_strings, is_significant) for common checks, and add unit tests and serialization helpers for JSON/YAML interchange.
