"""
[Tracing Core] - [Distributed tracing and latency breakdown]

# DATE: 2026-02-12
# AUTHOR: Keimpe de Jong
USAGE:
- Instantiate TracingCore and call create_span_context(trace_id, span_id)
  to obtain a standardized span context for downstream exporters.
- Use calculate_latency_breakdown(total_time, network_time) to separate
  agent thinking time from network latency (returns values in milliseconds
  and a think ratio).
- Use format_otel_log(name, attributes) to produce a single OTel-compatible
  telemetry event dict ready for ingestion.

WHAT IT DOES:
- Provides a small, focused API for creating span contexts, computing
  latency breakdowns, and formatting OpenTelemetry-style log events.
- Delegates heavy lifting to a rust_core extension when available for
  performance and falls back to pure-Python implementations on ImportError
  or runtime errors.
- Ensures outputs are normalized (trace/span ids, time in ms, ratio) and
  includes a simple INTERNAL-kind log envelope with a high-resolution
  timestamp.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO BETTER:
- Add explicit logging and error reporting when rust_core calls fail to
  make fallbacks observable and debuggable.
- Validate inputs (trace/span id formats, non-negative times) and document
  units clearly to avoid misuse.
- Expand OTel compatibility by adopting official semantic conventions,
  support trace/span parent relationships, and add unit tests and
  type-checked signatures; consider async-friendly interfaces and richer
  metadata support.
