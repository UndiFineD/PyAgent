 Add robust validation for timestamps, numeric bounds, and operator semantics; prefer stricter typing (from typing import TypedDict/Protocol where appropriate) and more explicit Optional usage. Expose async-friendly helpers for federation polling and streaming, unit tests for serialization/deserialization, and a stable adapter layer for switching between Python and rust implementations with feature-flagged fallbacks. Provide clear conversion helpers to/from telemetry_core.Metric and documented examples for exporters (Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog).
