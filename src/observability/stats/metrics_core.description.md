# Description: src/observability/stats/metrics_core.py

Module docstring (if present):

    MetricsCore - Pure calculation logic for metrics processing.

    This module contains all pure computational logic without I/O operations,
    making it a candidate for Rust conversion. It handles:
    - Token cost calculations
    - Metric aggregation and rollup
    - Formula evaluation and derived metrics
    - Correlation analysis
    - Statistical forecasting
    - A/B comparison analysis

    No I/O operations, no file access, no external calls.

Top-level members:
- Classes: TokenCostResult, TokenCostCore, ModelFallbackCore, DerivedMetricCalculator, StatsRollupCore, CorrelationCore, ABTestCore
